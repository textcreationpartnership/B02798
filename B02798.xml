         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">The Firſt Part was printed. 1642.</note> being the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of Gods Free and Full Grace and favour to miſerable man. In this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part is handled this point, What is Gods final End for which he made both Men and Angels, together with all things in Heaven and in Earth ſubſervient to them, their uſe and benefit; and alſo, that in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his final End, he doth Order and appoint both men and Angels to their Final Ends, according to their Works, good or bad, ſome for Honor, ſome for Diſhonor to Eternity; and it is granted on all ſides, that God doth order and appoint them thereunto. But
<pb facs="tcp:179408:4"/>all the Queſtion and Controverſie is, how he doth order and appoint them thereunto, Wherfore I have endeavored to help where moſt need is, for then and there help is moſt ſeaſonable, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my former Treatiſe is ſomething ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure by reaſon of the depth and heigth of the point there handled; namely, Election and Reprobation, and that in both Treatiſes; I deny perſonal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſonal Reprobation without reſpect to Faith or Works, good or bad: and this way goes Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> and others. Alſo I deny any Election of any man or men perſonally to Eternal life, infallibly upon Gods foreſight of their perſeverance in Faith and Works to the End, as that Reverend man <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> and others, for the Truth in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture falls between both theſe two miſtakes, yet to the Learned and Intelligent Reader that has his minde and wits exerciſed in Divine Miſteries, it is not obſcure; for before I printed that Firſt Part, I preſented my Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to three Grave, Reverend, and
<pb facs="tcp:179408:4"/>godly Divines to have their judgements upon it; namely, Dr. <hi>Twiſt,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and they all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it cleerly with much eaſe, for one of them ſaid unto me, that you in that Treatiſe ſay all that we do, but ſtay not there, but ſay a great deal more; my Anſwer was, becauſe you ſay not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the depth of the fall of man in the firſt Adam, nor to the raiſing of the World, and all mankinde by the ſecond Adam; therefore I muſt ſay more then you, and the height and depth of this point in this manner handled, is it that makes it obſcure to ſome that will not ſtudiouſly take pains to underſtand it, but in this ſecond part I have brought it as low and plain as I can to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all men, as the nature of the point will admit; and Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I wiſh thee as much good in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as I have had in ſtudying and writing it, Farewel,</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>In this Chapter by way of Introduction two things are premiſed, Firſt in what ſenſe known to God are all his Works; Secondly what is Gods final End, for which he made all things, that is both Men and Angels, and all his Works ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to them and their uſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is affirmed in the Text,
<note place="margin">Acts 15.18.</note> That from the beginning of the World God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his Works; Now all Gods Works whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as his, had a threefold beginning, and may be comprehended in three particulars;</p>
            <p>Firſt the Angels, and the Heaven of Heavens their own habitation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This inferior World, Mans Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and his preſervation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Worlds reſtoration by redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And theſe three comprehend all the Works of God, and every one had a threefold beginning known to God: as concerning the firſt, namely, Angels, it will be handled in the thirteenth Chapter.</p>
            <p>Secondly this inferior World, and Man its
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179408:7"/>principal part, had a threefold beginning; Firſt from its original Fountain, Gods own Eſſence its potential and virtual productive cauſe; and ſo this World in all its parts, Man the chief, was in God;
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.9, 10.</note> as <hi>Levy</hi> was when he was not, but in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes potentially: And as that vertue was in Chriſt which healed the woman of the bloudy Iſſue before it was extended to her health; and as a Roſe is in its root in Winter, when it is not exiſtent; ſo this World in all its parts, had its firſt beginning in Gods Eſſence, its potentiall, virtual, and productive cauſe; and therefore this beginning muſt needs be known to God, it being ſo in himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond beginning of the world, not in time, but in the order of Nature, was the ſecond ſtep of God to all his Works, namely the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his own Will; for the Text ſaith, He worketh all things after the Councel of his own Will,
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> and ſo the world was framed in all its parts before it was created; and ſo known to God in this beginning, it being alſo in himſelf.</p>
            <p>The third beginning of the World was, when God reduced the ſaid potency and councel as he purpoſed in himſelf,
<note place="margin">Gen. i. to verſe laſt.</note> to the production of the Creation in all its parts, by his Creative word, as appears in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods work of Redemption and Reſtauration of the World by Chriſt, when the Creation in all its parts in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion deſervedly fell into corruption, vanity, and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but not to its depth, becauſe God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did interpoſe the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:179408:7"/>unrighteouſneſs upon the whole world in all its parts,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.9. Rom. 5.18.</note> with the imputative ſatisfactory righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his tender mercies over all his works in this inferior world,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8. from 18 to 24.</note> and ſo put the whole creation in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to a poſture of travelling from that bondage of corruption unto now, untill the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; for this travel ariſeth not from its own will or natural inſtinct, but by God who hath ſubdued it by Chriſt's aforeſaid righteouſneſs; and this work of God had a threefold beginning as well as the Creation; for it is manifeſt by the Oracles of God, that Chriſt the ſeed of the woman was from Gods potency and his councel, as is implyed in that he was fore. ordained to be the Redeemer in time before the world was; and it is alſo implyed that then God look'd upon man as in the fallen Maſs in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, as under blame, unholy,

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.10.</note> which God that cannot lie hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before the world began;
<note place="margin">Prov. 8.22, 23, 24.</note> Therefore the great work of the worlds reſtauration, had the aforeſaid threefold beginning, and is and was ſo known from the beginning to God:
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> and from the premiſes thus proved, it clearly follows, that not only the innumerable number of men and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179408:8"/>Angels were known to God before they or the world did exiſt,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.2.</note> but alſo all their arbitrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, operations, and contingent workings, and all contingent events were known to God, as certain and not contingent to him,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> as that the Angels would apoſtate from their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tempt man, and that man alſo would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate from his firſt eſtate, and that from two particulars: Firſt from mans remiſſneſs to Gods word and rule: Secondly from the natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his will, implanted in him by God, which conſiſts in this, to chuſe and refuſe all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as it likes, or as it likes them not.</p>
            <p>From this ground it is that man in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency might or might not ſin, and ſo the ground how God permitted ſin to be both in men and Angels, and the ground of all contingency in their operations, events and contingencies: And therefore when God would make a means to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his final end unchangeably, he paſt by that contingent faculties in men and Angels, and pitcht only upon the ſeed of the woman perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God Man, ordained thereunto before the world, as we ſee, and as will appear in its due place. Now the ground why God knows all his works, as is proved, is this alſo; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he made all, but alſo the whole Creation, with the innumerable company of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels together, with their contingent events in all their works, with all circumſtances amounts but to a finite thing or things,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.</note> and therefore to the infinite God are as nothing for him to know, who calleth things that are not, as if they were,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179408:8"/>who diſcerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight;
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12, 13.</note> but all things are open and naked to his eyes; and ſaith the Text, <hi>All the Nations are as a drop of the bucket, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ſmall duſt of the ballance, he taketh up the Iſles as a very ſmall thing, all Nations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as nothing, and they are counted unto him leſs then nothing and vanity.</hi> And therefore it was all one to God to know all things when they were not, as now when they are, and are as nothing to him ſo much; for the firſt thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, namely, In what ſenſe known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing premiſed is this, What Gods final end is for which he made all things, namely both men and Angels, and all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive works ſubſervient to them and their uſe; In brief, it is no more then this, that which is and ſhall be upon men and Angels executed laſt, that was in creating all things by God, in order of nature intended firſt, and that was his final end, whatſoever it was. But more particular this is his final end, namely that he will make both men and Angels by their uſe of all that he hath indued them with, veſſels of honour, or veſſels of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to eternity, according to their works, good or bad, by his rule made ſuitable to them. But as concerning men, I muſt premiſe one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the point, That is, all mankind departing this world in infancy, or the like, are conſidered by God under another capacity, for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179408:9"/>which I refer the Reader to my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Free Grace,
<note place="margin">Pag. 36. to 39 and 44. John 6.39. Rev. 10.6.</note> printed 1642. to the pages in the Margent.</p>
            <p>But as concerning mankind, ſo to be made to honour and diſhonour, as is affirmed, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affirms its laſt execution and final conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhall be at the laſt day,
<note place="margin">Rev. 20.12, 13</note> that is after that day when time ſhall be no more, as now it is, in which day the Text affirms, all the dead ſhall be raiſed and judged every man according to his works,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> for ſaith another Text, <hi>We muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil;</hi> and that this ſhall be executed laſt, it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears by the words of our Saviour, who ſaith of himſelf, <hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come and all his holy Angels with him, then he ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25.31, 32. to 46.</note> 
               <hi>and he ſhall ſever them as a ſhepherd divideth the ſheep from the Goats.</hi> And he having inſtanced in one particular of works good and bad, as comprehending the nature and kinde of all their works, concludes all, namely, <hi>That the wicked ſhall goe into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the righteous into life everlaſting.</hi> So much for the ſecond thing premis'd, namely what Gods final end is, for which he made or created all things, namely both men and Angels, and all his works ſubſervient unto them and their uſe; the further inlargement of this point will fall in the following Chapters in its full proof, and what Gods ſuitable rule to man is: Hence obſerve,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179408:9"/>that the moving cauſe why God created all his works, was this final end, it being the ultimate end of all his glories centuring in himſelf; for which he made all things; yea the wicked for the day of evil, becauſe they all attempt to aſſume his glory, not to him, but to themſelves, which he will not give unto another, as will appear more in its due place.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. <hi>In which is made known a ſevenfold means to Gods foreſaid final end, whereof ſix are handled in this Chapter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe which End in order of Nature in Gods intention was firſt, and in execution laſt, and the means in Gods intention in order of nature laſt, but in execution firſt; Therefore the firſt thing that God did, he gave being to means for his final end, and they primarily were ſeven, ſome more remote and general, and ſome more near and more particular.</p>
            <p>The firſt means more remote and general, was this inferior world, as included in its remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt matter, which God did make out of no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent matter, as Heb. 11.3. and ſaith another Text, <hi>The earth was without form, and void,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> 
               <hi>and darkneſs was upon the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters;</hi> and yet the firſt verſe names it by the name of heaven and earth; and the ground of it is this, becauſe that confuſed lump was the preexiſtent matter of heaven and earth, and all things elſe; and the ground of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:179408:10"/>that is this, becauſe the ſpirit of God by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fil'd it with an intrinſical vigorous diſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be whatſoever God by his Creative Will and Word would command it to be:
<note place="margin">Rev. 4.11.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he commanded light out of that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1, 2, 3.</note> it preſently was; then ſaith the Text, <hi>God ſaid, Let there be light, and it was ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then God commanded a Firmament to be in the midſt of the waters, and the waters to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the waters, that is, the water under the Firmament, from the waters that were above the Firmament, and God called the Firmament Heaven, verſe 6, 7, 8. Then he commanded the waters to one place, and ſo the earth to be for uſe as now it is, verſe 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Then he commanded the life and being of all vegitable creatures, and it was ſo, verſe 11, 12. Then he commanded to be the Sun, Moon, and Stars in their orderly courſe and warbling influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to fall on the earth, and for ſignes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſucceſſion of daies and nights, and it was ſo, verſe 14. to 19.</p>
            <p>Then he commanded the innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all ſenſative creatures, to live and move and have their being, from verſe 20. to 25.</p>
            <p>Thus God gave being to the firſt means more remote and general to his final end.</p>
            <p>Then God gave being to a ſecond means more near and more particular, the principal part of the Creation: Namely, man, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal exiſtency was in a twofold nature, the one ſenſible, the other an intellectual ſpirit, or ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul: The firſt was his elementary body of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:179408:10"/>earth for a time a lifeleſs trunk, but God ſtaid not there, for ſaith the Text, <hi>And breathed in his noſtrils the breath of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>and man became a living ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe he was a principal part, the whole did terminate in his nutrimental ſupport, ſome to feed, ſome to cloth, the aire to imbreath, and the earth to bear, and the ſweet influence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of the heavenly bodies to his delight.</p>
            <p>Again, becauſe the chief part therein God put the whole to depend on his operations, not for his being, but for its wel or woe; and therefore the whole creation together with himſelf, fell into the aforeſaid vanity, bondage and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and man thus made, was Gods ſecond means, for man muſt firſt be, and ſo ſupported to be, before he could be to honour or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Gods foreſaid final end.</p>
            <p>Again, mans reaſonable ſoul being of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal nature, and ſo of an everlaſting duration, was therefore a third means ſuitable to Gods fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal end, that is, to be to honour or diſhonour to eternity, which could not be; if he were not of an everlaſting duration.</p>
            <p>From this ground it is that mans dead body ſhall be raiſed and ſpirituallized; therefore when ſome men denyed the immortality of their ſouls, and conſequently the everlaſting duration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our Lord proved to them the truth thereof: Have you not read what was ſpoken unto you of God, ſaying, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living:</hi> Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:179408:11"/>inferring to them that thoſe three men then were, and now are living, though their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are dead and turned to duſt.
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.31, 32.</note> Again God having indued mans reaſonable ſoul with two natural faculties, his underſtanding and will, the underſtanding its natural property to look to truth, as really ſuch, or as it appears ſo to be, and to judge, and accordingly ſo to operate the whole man: and to the will, Two things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to it, the one is, that it doth follow a good, as the eye doth follow the light, that is the true good, or as it appears ſo to be, the other is to nil and will, that is to chuſe and refuſe all objects as it likes, or as it likes them not; and ſo from this underſtanding and will, man from his own councel and voluntary choice, terminates all his works; wherefore it is a righteous thing in God to judge man according to his own works, good or bad; and therefore God made theſe twofold faculties, a fourth means to his ſaid final end: Again God implanted in mans internal knowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power in his firſt eſtate, the Law of Nature, that was naturally to love God above all, and his neighbour as himſelf, ariſing in man alſo by Gods demonſtrating his truth and goodneſs to man in the whole frame of nature; in all, through all and above all, and ſo man was internally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to work aright to any rule that God ſhould make ſuitable to him, and therefore this Law of Nature was a fifth means to Gods ſaid final end; for ſaith the Text,
<note place="margin">Col. 3.10. Gen. 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>Man was renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge after the Image of him that created him;</hi> but for a further enlargement of this Law of Nature,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:179408:11"/>I refer the Reader to the firſt Chapter of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe. Again a ſixth means to the ſaid final end, is, that before the fall God inſtituted a rule ſuitable to man, I ſay inſtituted by Gods own word of truth, namely, not to eat of the fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil upon pain of death, and here mans will might nil the evil of ſin, and the evil of puniſhment; and here mans underſtanding might adhere to truth, that is, the truth of God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.9 17.</note> and here his will might chuſe a good, that is, the good of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods command, and alſo the good of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, implyed in that word, Knowledge of good, and alſo in the name of that Tree of life. So thus by this rule God ordained to make man in the eſtate of innocency, a veſſel of honour or diſhonour to eternity, according to his works, good or bad, and ſo we are come to Gods final end, for which he made all things; I now ſhould come to the ſeventh means, but I muſt firſt in brief touch upon the fall of man, by way of Introduction, and ſo come unto it in the fourth Chapter.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="chapter">

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>In this Chapter is brifly toucht Mans fall by way of Introduction to the ſeventh means to Gods final End.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe fall of man was from God in his truth, the chiefeſt good to the Apoſtate Angels lies: and ſo to the deepeſt evil, for by this he loſt all relation to God, but to live, move and be, as have the Devils and damned, and became one with the Apoſtate Angels, not in their angelical nature, but their diabolical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deſerv'd damnation to eternity; for men and Angels became Devils, not by loſs or change of their eſſence or natures, but by change of their intentions and operations from Gods rules of truth,
<note place="margin">John 8.44.</note> to their own lies.</p>
            <p>But I muſt in a word premiſe one thing before I goe any further; that is, God in Scripture names the innumerable company of Apoſtate Angels, as if they were all but one; as by the name of Devil, a Lyar, a deſtroyer, that evil one, and ſo forth; and the ground is no more but this, becauſe they are all one in intentions and operations, in their deſignes againſt Gods glory in this final end.</p>
            <p>Therefore when they ſaw or underſtood by Gods inſtituted Rule to man, that he had thus laid the Platform of his Glory in his final end to eternity,
<note place="margin">Mar. 5.9. 1 John 3.8.</note> then they laid their Platform how to confound and fruſtrate Gods final end in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:179408:12"/>to his glory, in one particular branch, and that from a twofold ground. Firſt that branch was this,
<note place="margin">Rev, 12.9.</note> they envied man as being but a part of this inferior world, a ſenſative creature, that he ſhould be put in a poſture by his operations to Gods rule, and ſo in a poſſibility to riſe to that glory which primitively was their own.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground, becauſe God juſtly for their ſin rejected them from that glory, and ſo ſtood reſerved in Chains of darkneſs unto the Judgement of the great day; therefore they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpoil God of his glory, and as their end led them to their means, ſo their means leads us to ſee that this was their end; for becauſe they knew man in reſpect of his body was a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive creature, and therefore they were to man inviſible, wherefore their firſt means was a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature and ſubtilly diſpoſed; ſaith the Text,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>Now the Serpent was more ſubtil then any beast of the field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſecond means was the Serpents tongue,
<note place="margin">Num. 22.28.30</note> by actuating it as the good Angel did the Aſſes tongue, ſo to convey their minds in ſpeaking to the woman in that ſpeech and language which God had made natural and familiar to man; for the Text ſaith, <hi>He ſaid to the woman, yea hath God indeed ſaid, ye ſhall not eat,</hi> and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Their third means was to wave the man in this buſineſs, becauſe moſt ſtrong,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.14. 1 Tim. 2.14.</note> and to pitch upon the woman, the weaker veſſel, and ſo to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the man by her, the more unperceived by him.</p>
            <p>Again, becauſe the woman replyed to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:179408:13"/>Serpent, Gods word from his inſtituted rule; namely, that God hath ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat, and ſo forth. And by this they did perceive that two things did interrupt and indanger their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne: The firſt was Gods word by his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rule; the ſecond was the womans credit or belief, that ſhe did or might give to it, becauſe by the natural liberty of her will, ſhe might chuſe Gods word, and refuſe theirs.</p>
            <p>Therefore they betook themſelves to a fourth means of their own; namely a Lie, or Lies to prevent that danger of their deſired end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Serpent to the woman they ſaid, Ye ſhall not die at all, implying unto her, there was no truth in thoſe words concerning their dying if they did eat of the forbidden fruit, for God doth know, in the day that ye ſhall eat thereof, that your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods knowing good and evil, implying Gods rule obeyed was the only thing that kept her from aſpiring to ſo great a happineſs, therefore God is an impoſter to you, and not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but diſobeyed for your own good upon theſe Lies;
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> the woman looked on the Tree the more wiſhly; for the Text ſaith, <hi>When the woman ſaw the Tree was good for food, and that it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant for the eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> ſhe hereupon wil'd the Devils lies, and nil'd Gods truth, believing to operate to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted rule; for the Text ſaith, <hi>She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with her, and he did eat:</hi> Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels by their four means accompliſhed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:179408:13"/>their end, by fruſtrating Gods final End, in one main branch, as they ſuppoſed, in the loſs of his glory, and to his diſhonour for ever, by nulling his truth, in that all mankind together with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might fall into eternal miſery, and ſo not one ever ſhould aſpire to eternal happineſs that glory over theirs: For in <hi>Adam</hi> all die, that is, eternally veſſels of diſhonour. But for the further enlargement of the fall of man, I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the third Chapter of my former Treatiſe; but now in this particle of time when man fell, and the world with him, then God gave being to the ſeventh means to cary on his final End, by the aſſent of humane nature, to eternal glory, in his manifold wiſdom, to the rebounding of his glory to all eternity, notwithſtanding what was done by the Apoſtate Angels, as will appear in the next Chapter and Chapters following.</p>

            <p>IN this caſe, as is ſaid, God paſſed by Men and Angels, becauſe this means is not man only, nor God only, but perſonally God Man, that is, the ſecond in the one God aſſumed, not the perſon of any man, but the nature of every man, as it was ſaid the ſeed of the woman. And this perſon by this perſonal union, was made the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179408:14"/>the ſeventh means in the beginning of time, namely in that inſtant of time in which the whole frame of Nature fell, by its principal part, as is deſcribed,

            </head>
            <p>IN this Point fals in the manfold wiſdom of God; but I will pitch only upon ſix principal Branches thereof, as firſt, When man became with the apoſtate Angels one, in deſerved miſery to eternity, and alſo one in their diabolical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is proved then in that point of time: In the ſeed of the woman God elected the fallen maſs of man-kind out of that ſtate, into a poſture in which all man-kind may receive the ſaid gift of life attained by Chriſt the ſecond Adam, which they loſt in Adam, or be either Veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſhonour to eternity, according to their works, good or bad.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.18.</note> That as Adams unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the fall by one offence in its guilt and puniſhment by God was imputed to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even ſo the one righteouſneſs of the ſeed of the woman the ſecond Adam by Gods gift imputatively came upon all man kind and ſo put al men by mercy in a poſture in which they might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:179408:16"/>receive the ſaid gift of life, or to be either, as is ſaid.</p>
            <p>The third Branch, That immediately upon the ſaid Election and Imputation by the Spirit of Chriſt, God put an internal diſpoſedneſs into all man-kind to deſcend hereditarily in their natural generations, diſpoſing them to operations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaid poſture.</p>
            <p>The fourth Branch, immediately upon the ſaid Election and Imputation, the ſame Spirit of Chriſt began to ſtrive, and ſtill ſo doth with the ſpirits of all men to keep them in that poſture, in all ages, and in all places of the world.</p>
            <p>The fifth branch, immediately upon that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Imputation, God in mercy gave a rule ſuitable to all man-kind in the ſtate they are in by that Election, to direct their operations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from their internal diſpoſedneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſaid gift of life, and to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary death.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Branch, That according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of all men, good or bad, God by that ſuitable rule maketh them veſſels of honour or diſhonour to eternity: So that thus by this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth means Gods final end is carried on, and accompliſhed eternally to his glory in the ſaid branch, notwithſtanding what was done by the apoſtate Angels: In mans fall, or ever fince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that God ſaid unto the Serpent, <hi>He ſhall break thy head.</hi> Of theſe ſix branches in their order; Firſt in the Election of the falne maſs of mankind out of that ſtate into the ſaid poſture, which is the firſt branch propoſed, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179408:17"/>foundation of this univerſal election, was laid in the humane nature of Chriſt, the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; I will put enmity, ſaith God, between thy ſeed and her ſeed, clearly implying that humane nature, as ſuch, womans offspring was elected out of that falne Maſs into the ſaid poſture in Chriſt, but not the nature of Angels, but left to ſink deeper in their falne eſtate and deſigne, by the power of Chriſt the womans ſeed; for ſaith God, He ſhal break thy head; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle affirms the ſame, He choſe us in him, ſaith he, before the foundation of the world; and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies in the Text as before is noted, Mans Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was out of the fallen maſs, that is, as unholy and under blame, and not loved as in our ſelves; and therefore he ſaith, He choſe us in him that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.
<note place="margin">Eph. 1.1.4.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> points out, that our Election was to the ſaid poſture, when he ſaith, Elect according to the fore-knowledg of God the Father, unto ſanctification of the ſpirit, through obedience and ſprinkling of the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This word Us in the Text, He choſe us, in its full drift and ſcope, is to be underſtood in a twofold ſenſe, that is, reſtrictively and univerſally,</p>
            <p>Reſtrictively thus, He choſe us, that is, us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mankind, which believingly operate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our rule and poſture, as all were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto to receive eternal life by Chriſts own righteouſneſs imputed, ſo that he choſe us into the poſſeſſion of that eternal life in belief; and ſo this word Us, comprehends all Believers, only
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179408:17"/>as ſuch to whom the Epiſtle was ſent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This word Us is to be underſtood, Us Men, that is, Humane Nature, as ſuch; and ſo it comprehends all man-kind univerſally, as choſen out of the falne maſs into the ſaid poſture when the falne nature of Angels were left to ſink deeper into their diabolical nature and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as is proved.</p>
            <p>But if it be queſtioned what that poſture is, to which all man-kind was elected unto out of the falne Maſs.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, It is no more but this, namely, A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs to operate to receive the ſaid gift of life; and to make up this meet diſpoſedneſs, there goes a threefold ingredient.</p>
            <p>Firſt, as is ſaid, immediately upon the ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Imputation by the Spirit of Chriſt, God put an internal diſpoſedneſs into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, hereditarily to deſcend in their natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, diſpoſing them in operation according to the ſaid poſture, which fals to be handled in the third Branch of the manifold wiſdom of God propounded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, immediately upon the ſaid election and imputation, the ſame Spirit of Chriſt began to ſtrive, and ſtill ſo doth with the ſpirits of all men, to keep them in that poſture in all ages, and in all places of the world, which is to be handled in the fourth Branch propounded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, immediately up on that election and imputation God gave a rule ſuitable to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in that ſtate they are in by that election, to direct their operations to receive the ſaid gift of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:179408:18"/>of life, and to avoid the contrary death which fals to be handled in the fift branch propounded; the which threeing redients make up the ſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
            <p>And from this poſture it is that moſt men in the world before they can come to receive Gods gifts of juſtifying faith,
<note place="margin">Iona 2.8.</note> do apoſtate to lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ſo forſaking their own mercies; Thus did <hi>Cain</hi> and the old world before the Flood, for which God brought in the Flood. Thus did <hi>Noah's</hi> poſterity after the Flood, apoſtate to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, by building the City of <hi>Babel,</hi> and a Tower therein to reach the Heavens, for which God confounded and ſcattered them. Thus did <hi>Terah</hi> in <hi>Shems</hi> Family, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Father, apoſtate to Idols, and ſo became a Den of Devils.</p>
            <p>But when all Families of the earth was thus ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">Ioſ 24.2, 3, 4. Ezek. 16. from 3. to 15.</note> as veſſels of diſhonour eternally for ought themſelves can do, from which condition that aforeſaid election out of Adams fall, relieved man into the ſaid poſture, yet nevertheleſs then in that point of time, in purſuance of his final end, God taketh hold of the univerſal nature of man, and preſerves it from ſinking; for he not only commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to depart from his Country and kindred, and from his father <hi>Terah</hi>'s houſe, but with reference to that very time, ſaith the Text, Verily he taketh not hold on the nature of Angels, but of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hold. Theſe words lead us to a fourfold Querie.</p>
            <p>Firſt, why <hi>Abraham</hi> is named more in this buſineſſe then any other man?</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:179408:18"/>
            <p>Secondly, Why <hi>Abraham</hi> is named in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſeed of man, as in his loynes, he being <hi>Terah's</hi> ſon?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> Why was not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s perſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd in perſonal union with the ſecond in the one God, he being thus named by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in the Text?</p>
            <p n="4">4 Why this word he taketh hold as to the nature of Angels is ſpoken negatively, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature of man affirmatively, both being in the fall, one in apoſtacy, as is proved; nay now all Nations of men were in a relapſt apoſtacy to them, we ſee, and as will more appear in due place?</p>
            <p>For Anſwer unto the firſt Querie,
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.1.</note> Why <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is named more in this buſineſs then any other man; It was becauſe when all the Families of the earth did apoſtate at <hi>Babel</hi> except <hi>Semes,</hi> wherefore in his Family the Oracle of Chriſt was only reſident, and becauſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> father <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was the firſt in that Family that did apoſtate from this poſture to Idols, and became a den of Devils, <hi>Abraham</hi> being his ſon, was therefore named rather then any other man, implying mans miſery is Gods oportunity; for in the Mount will the Lord be ſeen, as to all mankind in the falne maſs he was.</p>
            <p>Anſwer to the ſecond Queſtion, Why <hi>Abraham</hi> is named in reference to the ſeed of man in his loynes, he being <hi>Terah's</hi> ſon; the meaning is, no more but this, the proper ſubject of election is not only man as corrupt, but as univerſally corrupt: Therefore God names the common
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179408:19"/>ſeed of man in the loynes of one of this idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous brood, the fitteſt Emblem of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act of God in Election of man out of the falne maſs, as in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns, and therefore the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is named in the Text.</p>
            <p>Anſwer to the third Query, Why was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon aſſum'd into perſonal union with the ſecond in the one God, he being thus named by way of eminency in the Text? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, If <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſon, or any mans elſe, had been aſſumed to the ſecond in the one God, it would have pointed out a perſonal election and rejection of mankind, and therefore to remove that, he aſſumed not the perſon of any man, but the nature of every man, and ſo elected humane natures falne maſs out of that eſtate into the ſaid poſture, either to honour or diſhonour for ever, as is proved.</p>
            <p>Anſwer to the fourth Query, Why this word he taketh Hold, as to the nature of Angels, is ſpoke negatively, and to the common nature of man affirmatively, both being in the fall one in Apoſtacy; nay now all Nations of men were relapſt in Apoſtacy as we are? Anſwer, The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is no more then this, When men univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do apoſtate from the ſaid poſture ſo ſinking unto deſtruction, then ſometimes in this caſe in purſuance of his final end, God as a continued act to the nature of Angels, letteth the nature of Angels ſink lower and lower into deſtruction, and as a continued act, taketh hold of the nature of man to ſtay it from ſinking; and therefore the Text ſpeaketh negatively to them, and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179408:19"/>to man; for firſt he taketh hold of the nature of man by promiſe, into perſonal union with the ſecond in the one God, when the ſeed of the woman was firſt named, and in theſe words to <hi>Abraham,</hi> In thy ſeed ſhall all Nations be bleſſed; God ſaith not of ſeeds, as of many, but as of one, that is Chriſt, ſaith the Text; and here he taketh not hold of the nature of Angels; but here we ſee he takes hold of the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in Chriſt's perſon.</p>
            <p>Again, the extent of this taking hold reacheth all Nations, for God did not only take hold of the humane nature into the perſon of Chriſt, as is ſaid, but alſo taketh hold of a ſeed of humane nature in a national extent at that time by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, in the ſeed to be when they were not, and to this end to be a means to return the bleſſing of Chriſt upon humane nature over all Nations, that is, to return them to the aforeſaid poſture in which they might receive the ſaid gift of eternal life, and all comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe words to <hi>Abraham;</hi> I will make of thee a great Nation, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing, in thee ſhall all the Families of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: that is, that now lie under a curſe in my wrath in Heatheniſm: And here again God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not hold of the nature of Angels, but in the election of this one Nation in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns, of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> he taketh hold as a continued act of the univerſal election of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> falne maſs.</p>
            <p>But if you ask me what was that wrath they lie under, and how all Nations but one became
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179408:20"/>Heathens; I anſwer, It was when <hi>Jehovah</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God, and ſaw that they were all gone out of the way, and all corrupt and abominable, which made God wrath with them, under which wrath they then lay.</p>
            <p>If you ask me when this was, God came down to ſee.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It was when Jehovah came down to ſee the City of <hi>Babel</hi> and the Tower, that the offspring of <hi>Noah</hi> was building in the Plain of <hi>Shinor,</hi> for then and there he confounded their Language, and ſo ſcattered them upon the face of all the earth to walk in their own waies, and ſo they all became Heathens, excepting a very few, untill by vertue of the ſaid continued Act of a twofold laying hold of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they were put into that poſture in which they might receive the ſaid gift of eternal life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, The Scriptures fore-ſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, Preach the Goſpel before unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, In thee ſhall all the Nations be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve,
<note place="margin">Obſerve.</note> that in the ſaid taking hold of this Nation in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loyns or ſeed, God not only elected that Nation to be as a part of the whole nature of man; but as ſuch to be Chriſts viſible Church and Spouſe, I ſay the nature of man as ſuch, but not Angels nature as ſuch, nor elected he this Nation upon his fore-ſight of their faith or believing operations,
<note place="margin">Eſa 44.1. Pſal. 147.20.</note> but to be put in the ſaid poſture in which they might believe, and in

<note place="margin">Rom. 3.2. Hoſ. 2.19.20.</note> For unto them was committed the Oracles of God, when denyed to all Nations; wherefore ſaith God to this Nation, I will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee unto me for ever, and ſo forth,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.29.30.</note> in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my final end, for that's imply'd; and in this ſenſe the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. From this ground God did call the Gentiles to the ſaid poſture, and ſo will the Iews that now lay in their apoſtacy; and I ſay in this ſenſe the gifts and callings of God are without repentance to mankind, with reſpect to his ſaid final end.</p>

And then the Apoſtle demonſtrates a reaſon of this reconciliation of all mankind into the ſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; namely, becauſe God hath made Chriſt to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</p>
            <p>But ſin inherently was not in him, nor actually committed by him; for the Text ſaith, He knew no ſin; and himſelf ſaith, Sathan has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in me: therefore he was only imputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made ſin for us; and contrarily we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively only made the righteouſneſs of God in him to juſtification and acceptation into the ſaid poſture to a right reception of the ſaid gift of eternal life, in purſuance of Gods ſaid final end: Therefore as by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reigne in life by one Ieſus Chriſt. Thus all mankind were put into the ſaid poſture by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Again, if the whole frame of nature was put into a poſture by Chriſts righteouſneſs imputed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:179408:22"/>in oppoſition to the unrighteouſneſs imputed of <hi>Adam,</hi> as is proved, and ſo travelleth untill now from the bondage of corruption, to be partakers of the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, then much more did the force of the imputation of that righteouſneſs put the principal part of the frame of Nature, namely, man into the ſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of reception of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve that the imputed guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence, and the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gift of Chriſts one righteouſneſs were both of one univerſal extent to the whole Creation, and ſo to all mankind, the principal part thereof; for even as one extended judgement to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon all,
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.1.</note> even ſo we ſee the other remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the guilt and puniſhment thereof, that is, of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence; ſo as never man periſhed for it, that is, for Adams one offence once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; for it came, as ſaith the Text, upon all men to juſtification of life, as is proved.</p>
            <p>Again, obſerve, That in this univerſal juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Point of remiſſion of the ſaid guilt and puniſhment, ſo far as to put all men into a capacity to the ſaid poſture: I ſay, Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That mans faith or belief was of no uſe in this juſtification, for we ſee it came upon all men when it was neither thought on, nor ſought by them, even when God ſaid, <hi>Adam,</hi> Where art thou? Seeking to ſave that which was loſt in the ſeed of the woman, by breaking the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, as is proved.</p>
            <p>Again, Though in point of remiſſion of the guilt and puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence, ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179408:23"/>farr as to put man into a capacity to the ſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, his faith was of no uſe; but obſerve, that as that righteouſneſs is a gift which brought in it the ſaid life, ſo alſo in this point, mans belief of this truth is now of uſe; namely, as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental qualification in point of reception of that gift; for as it is a gift, ſo it muſt be received; for as the imputative gift gives man right unto eternal life, ſo his reception of it gives him poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that gift from this ground; It is ſaid, He that believeth hath eternal life; but he that receives it not, has it not, and therefore abideth in death, becauſe he hath not believed in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p>Again, Obſerve therefore when the Scripture affirms man is juſtified by faith, it is becauſe by his belief he received this juſtification, as is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this Point of Eternal life; for then he hath the end of what did precede his reception thereof; namely, of the remiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence, and the ſaid capacity to the ſaid poſture, becauſe he hath ſo received that gift of eternal life.</p>
            <p>Again, If this gift of righteouſneſs thus came upon all men to juſtification, as is deſcribed, hence obſerve; That to aſcribe juſtification to a mans Faith or Belief, is to arrogate to man that which is not his, becauſe we ſee it is in the ſaid gift of righteouſneſs; and alſo this doth dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Gods glory in that gift of life, as alſo from the glory of Chriſt who obtained it by his righteouſneſs, as well as the remiſſion of the guilt and puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence, &amp; the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179408:23"/>ſaid capacity to that poſture in which by faith, he may receive the ſaid gift of life, as precedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is proved, and as will further appear in due place.</p>
            <p>Again, If the ſaid gift of life came upon all men, as is proved: Hence obſerve, That when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, he means as faith is an inſtrumental quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſubmitting to this righteouſneſs of God by receiving it by belief of the Doctrine in Chriſt, as in oppoſition to a ſuppoſed Doctrine of Works to attain eternal life, maintained by the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the fleſh, but not his children after the faith, in this Doctrine of Chriſt, as clearly appears in the drift and ſcope of the third and fourth Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If this gift of righteouſneſs ſo came upon all men to juſtification, and that before faith; it juſtifies as in pardon of <hi>Adams</hi> one offence, and ſo brought all mankind into the ſaid capacity and poſture, and this gift of life to them, then certainly God never ordained nor inſtituted mans faith or belief for his juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, for acceptance to pardon of his ſin, and life eternal, but it only comes upon man in his gift of this one righteouſneſs, as is deſcribed; but for what this one righteouſneſs is, I refer the Reader to my former Treatiſe, in pag. 113.</p>

            </head>
            <p>TO this end, immediately after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> God diſſolved the total amity of Will and operations, which was between man and the Apoſtate Angels, for God no ſooner will'd it, but immediately he did it by ſaying to the Serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> mans productive root, for that is implyed; but the foundation of it, and the deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of an internal diſpoſedneſs in all mankind to the ſaid poſture, was laid in the ſeed of the woman, namely, in Humane Nature in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, who only made way to it by breaking the Serpents head; for as <hi>Adam</hi> in his fall deſervedly brought a total internal darkneſs as well as death upon all men, ſo Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam deſervedly,
<note place="margin">John 1.4.9.</note> is life and light in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for as ſaith the Text, In it was life, and that life was the light of men, this was the true light
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179408:24"/>which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. Thus the Spirit of Chriſt doth write his Law in the hearts of all mankind,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> as a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Act in their natural generation; from this only ground it is that all mankind do by nature the things contained in Chriſts Law; which, as ſaith the Text, ſheweth the effect of the Law written in their hearts; if written, then it muſt needs be, God writ it by Chriſts Spirit, there being no middle ſtate between perfection before his fall, and a total devaſtation of righteouſneſs and holineſs in his fall.</p>
            <p>Again, If the effect of Chriſts Law be in the hearts of all mankind, and diſpoſeth them natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to do the ſame things, as ſaith the Text; conſequently this is a diſpoſedneſs to amity with God; and conſequently this is a diſpoſedneſſe to enmity to the apoſtate Angels deſigne in all mankind, according as God ſaid, I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thee and the woman: from this light of Chriſt in every man it is, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences doe accuſe and excuſe, as the Candle of the Lord in every mans breaſt, which he hath thus ſet up.</p>
            <p>Again, We find in men that are apoſtate from the ſaid poſture to Idols, by cuſtom or the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red habits, dead in ſins and treſpaſſes to that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to receive the ſaid gift of life; yet we find in them the remainders of this light of Chriſt; I do not mean ſo much remaining only among the beſt of the Heathens, who by a patient well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did ſeek honour and glory, immortality, and eternal life, as in the aforeſaid Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179408:25"/>but as for inſtance, thoſe Idolaters mentioned in <hi>Jonah,</hi> as appears in two particulars; Firſt they did believe that God is, although remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And ſecondly that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, although they do it with much confuſion; and the like in the Ninivites; but firſt in the Marriners, they referr their cauſe by lot to God to determine a point of difficulty; implying, they did believe, though remotely, yet truely, that God is; and conceiving the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, they prayed him not to lay innocent bloud to them; implying, they did believe he is a rewarder of thoſe that ſeek him.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the King of <hi>Ninnive,</hi> he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God, as ſaith the Text, that is, That God is, as well as his threatnings, to be true by <hi>Jonah.</hi> And as for the ſecond, That he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him, is clear alſo, becauſe he did ſeek him upon this reaſon, ſaying, Who knows whether God will be intreated to turn away from his firſt wrath. If thus much amity toward God be in ſuch men as theſe, certainly ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of enmity to Satan, and amity to God, is in all mankind: Hence it follows without all contradiction, that the precedent premiſſes are true, That Chriſt is the true light which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man which cometh into the world: Hence it is that our Lord ſaid unto ſuch men, or that man which by cuſtom in ſin, hath turned that light into darkneſs, as we ſee here theſe men had done, ſaying, If the light which is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</p>
            <p>Again, The force of this internal light and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179408:25"/>Law of Chriſt demonſtrates it ſelf to be his Law by this particular in all mankind, that is, as Chriſt himſelf is Gods only Seat of mercy, or mercies ſeat to the world; ſo all mankind in their diſtreſs invocate God to take off their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery under the notion of mercy; ſo cannot the apoſtate Angels invocate God under the notion of mercy or pitty, and the ground of it is this, as they have no internal princple by Chriſt, as here we ſee all mankind hath, therefore they have no internal diſpoſedneſs to ſeek relief from him under the notion of mercy: and from this ground it is, that their conſciences cannot excuſe them, as mens can do.</p>

               </label> The natural Liberty of the Will is one thing, and the natural Property of the Will is another; For, as the natural property of the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is to adhere to Truth, as ſuch, or as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be ſuch; ſo the natural property of the will of man is to adhere to God, as ſuch, or as it appears to be ſuch; and in the fall man loſt not this natural property no more then its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty; but the rectitude thereof was total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, both in Will and underſtanding; for he loſt all righteouſneſs and holyneſs wholly, and ſo became totally evil as are the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for there was no middle eſtate in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, but good and evil.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the depth of that darkneſs, Chriſt enlightneth by his Spirit, the intellectual ſpirits of all mankind, ſo farr as attendency to adhere to truth, and to the true good, as ſuch, which includes a vertual tendency to love God above all, and its neighbour as it ſelf: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Will by the aſſiſtance of Chriſts Spirit, may be terminated to one thing to which it has
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179408:26"/>thus a natural tendency; as in the Saints, when they in the third degree of belief are Fathers in the faith,
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.10, 11, 12. Rom. 8. from 35 to 39. 1 Tim. 1.19, 20 2 Tim, 2.12, 13 Acts 10.34, 35 See my former Treatiſe; p. 108 131, 132, 133. and from page 134 to 140.</note> then God ſo terminates their wils to himſelf, vertually at leaſt, that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate them from him, nor he from them: and the grounds why God will ſo termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Will to the Saints that improve their meaſure under manifold tryals, is this, He loves to glorifie his Juſtice in the diſtribution of his mercy by the Goſpels Tenor: ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to the Saints which totally backſlide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to the third degree of Faith, ſo farr as to make ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience; he by the juſtice of the ſame rule of mercy, doth make that final, which they have made total; for God is no reſpecter of perſons.</p>
            <p>The ground why this internal diſpoſedneſs is Chriſts Law, is not only becauſe it is infuſed by Chriſts Spirit, as is proved; but alſo the whole government of all mankind in relation to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and death,
<note place="margin">Acts 7.53. Gal. 3.19.</note> is only and alone in his power ſince the fall, and therefore he gives all Laws external or internal, and he adjudges men for tranſgreſſing thoſe Laws. This was that which was figured at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when God gave all thoſe Laws to that one Nation, as a part of the whole of mankind, he then gave all thoſe Laws by an Angel into the hand of a Mediator, the which Mediator was Chriſt in the truth, but <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Type, who adminiſtred thoſe Laws to the people.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve, That all mankind in their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179408:27"/>native production and ſucceeding generations, are not conceived and born dead in ſins and in treſpaſſes, nor children of wrath; for by reaſon of the ſaid univerſal election, and univerſal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts own righteouſneſs, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are conceived and born in the favour and mercy of God by Chriſt, notwithſtanding the bitter ſeed of original ſin in their natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; for we ſee it is reduced to be but a ſeed by the ſaid internal diſpoſedneſs, and ſo are in a capacity to receive the ſaid gift of life; for the whole need not the Phyſitian, but the ſick, ſince Original corruption is an evil privitive and poſitive.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THis Spirit of Chriſt thus began to ſtrive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the fall, and upon the ſaid univerſal election, and univerſal imputation in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179408:27"/>theſe words, <hi>Adam,</hi> Where art thou? ſo ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave what was loſt, and ſo forth.
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Thus Chriſt's Spirit ſtrived with the ſpirits of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> To <hi>Abel</hi> in an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and confirmation of his operations in this poſture, to continue to receive and hold faſt the ſaid gift of life; for ſaith the Text, God had reſpect unto <hi>Abel,</hi> and to his offering; and the reaſon is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.4.</note> becauſe it was by belief <hi>Abel</hi> offered a more acceptable offering then <hi>Cain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the ſame with <hi>Cains</hi> ſpirit; for when he began to go on in nouriſhing the ſeed of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin to the acquired habits therein, ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the light of Chriſt in him, then the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt ſtrived with his ſpirit to ſuppreſs the one, and to cheriſh and increaſe the other; for in reſpect to the one, God gave him no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but to his diſcontent and diſcouragement; but in reſpect to the other, he encourages him to goe on in his poſture, as <hi>Abel</hi> his brother, ſaying, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? implying moſt certainly, Thou ſhalt as well as he.</p>
            <p>Now the ground why this Spirit is the Spirit of Chriſt, that thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of all mankind, as with theſe two men it did; is this, Becauſe ever ſince the falne Maſs of mankind, Chriſt immediately entred, as the firſt-born of every creature in an univerſal relation to the whole world, in purſuance of Gods ſaid final end, and thereupon according to his own ſaying, All things that the Father hath are mine; and ſo ſaith he, The Spirit ſhall take of mine; that is,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179408:28"/>not only to comfort the faithfull in this world,
<note place="margin">John 16.8, 9, 10, 11.</note> but alſo to reprove the world of ſin, that is, to the ſame end as to <hi>Cain;</hi> and ſaith the Text, When he ſhall come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgement: Of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me; Of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe I goe to my Father; Of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the Prince of this world is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And according to this, the ſaid Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of all men, as to <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſo to the worlds end, that is, to depreſs the one, and increaſe the other, as is ſaid, to bring them into the ſaid poſture, and to preſerve them therein; and it clearly appears, that it ſo did ſtrive with man, during the firſt world; for ſaith God, When their Apoſtacy did abound, my Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man,
<note place="margin">Geneſis 6.3.</note> for that he alſo is fleſh.</p>
            <p>Whereupon God limited the time of the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſts Spirit with them from time to come,
<note place="margin">Gen. 7.1.</note> to one hundred and twenty years, and no longer;
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18, 19 20.</note> and as this Spirit ſtriveth with <hi>Abels</hi> ſpirit to preſerve him and eſtabliſh him in the ſaid poſture: conſequently ſo did it with all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the generations precedent, and to the end of that world, even untill there was but one righteous man left, ſaying unto them, Thee have I ſeen righteous before me in this generation, ſo eſtabliſhing and confirming his mind in the ſaid poſture,; ſo that thus the Spirit of Chriſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the ſpirits of the men of that world, both good and bad, when once thelong patience

            <p>Again, In the next world thus the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrived with the ſpirits of all men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the one, and to depreſs the other, as is ſaid, and that by the Miniſtry of Chriſt, by <hi>Noah</hi> to his own poſterity, who, ſaith the Text,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.8.</note> was a Preacher of righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">Gen. 9.28.</note> the which righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he preached to their ſpirits was two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; The firſt was manifeſted to them by the Sacrifices he offered unto God, which figured unto them the ſatisfactory righteouſneſs of the ſeed of the woman imputatively,
<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21, 22</note> bringing to them the ſaid gift of eternal life, and alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſted, in that God ſmelled a ſavour of reſt, and from thence ratifying to them and their generations, the good of this world, and that to come, in reference to keep them in the ſaid poſture in their ſucceeding generations:
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.2.</note> and to this end <hi>Noah</hi> their Father lived thus with them three hundred and fifty years after the Flood.</p>
            <p>The ſecond righteouſneſs which he preached, was the rectitude of his operations, which is ſanctification; and this he preached to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by his poſture in the right reception of Gods gift of eternal life, by the manner of his ſacrificing and building an Altar unto Jehovah, and by making choice of Beaſts, in refuſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and taking clean,

            <p>Again, When this Family began to Apoſtate from the ſaid poſture to Idols, as appears in <hi>Terah</hi> the Father of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and were become corrupt and abominable, not knowing the way of peace, like to thoſe who were confounded and ſcattered at <hi>Babel;</hi> then it is implyed, that God precedently had ſtrived with their ſpirits; for now he began to put an end to the ſtriving of the Spirit of Chriſt with the ſpirit of <hi>Shems</hi> Family, in that God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to depart from his Kindred, and from his Fathers houſe, to this end, to raiſe a Nation out of his loynes, to carry on Gods ſaid final end, and ſo leave that Family to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Again, When that one Nation was exiſtent, and did ſpring out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in number as the ſands on the Sea-ſhore, or as the Stars in Heaven, then the ſame Spirit of Chriſt ſtrived with their ſpirits alſo, in the ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to preſerve and increaſe the one, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the other, to bring them into the ſaid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179408:29"/>in which they might receive the ſaid gift of life, as ſaith <hi>Nehemiah</hi> unto God,
<note place="margin">Neh. 9.20, 30.</note> Thou gaveſt them thy good Spirit to inſtruct them;
<note place="margin">Hagg. 2.5.</note> and ſaith God to them, According to my Covenant with you when I came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit remaineth with you: And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaith alſo, Yea many years dideſt thou bear with them, and teſtifiedſt againſt them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets; but for their gain ſaying this Spirit ſo ſtriving with them all the day-long in their generations, God put a period to this ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſts Spirit, ſo denying them the gift of faith to believe, that they might not receive his ſaid gift of eternal life; and therefore ſaith the Text, excepting to ſome few of them, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, for I work a work in your daies,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.6. Luke 19.41, 42 Hab. 1.5. Acts 13.41.</note> which ye ſhall in no wiſe believe, although a man declare it unto you. Hence it is our Saviour ſaid, If thou hadſt known, even thou in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hidden from thine eyes.</p>
            <p>Again, under the Goſpel, now it is unvailed of <hi>Moſes</hi> vail, and that the viſible Churches of Chriſt ſtand conſtituted, not as Family-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es only, as to the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor conſtituted a viſible Church, as was that one Nation, a part of Humane Nature, as ſuch, were they good or bad; but now under the Goſpel conſtituted of Believers, as ſuch, according to the judgement of harity: And thus the Spirit of Chriſt alſo ſtrived with the ſpirits of men in the viſible Churches, as well as unto the men of the world,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179408:30"/>to cheriſh and increaſe one, and to depreſs the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to keep them in the ſaid poſture in a right reception of the gift of life: Hence ſaith the Spirit of Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Smerna,</hi> Be thou faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee the Crown of Life. Thus the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrived with the ſpirits of men in the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Remember therefore how thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and heard, and hold faſt and repent; If thou therefore wilt not watch,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.10.</note> I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know the hour when I will come upon thee.
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.11.</note> And ſo likewiſe to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Chriſts Spirit ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with their ſpirits,
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.4.</note> Behold I come ſhortly, hold that which thou haſt, let no man take away thy Crown: And this Point is apparent, for the ſeven Epiſtles were ſent to the ſeven Churches. So much for the Spirit of Chriſt ſtriving with the ſpirits of men in the viſible Churches under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Again, Not only with the viſible, but the ſame Spirit ſtrives with the ſpirits of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members of Chriſt's myſtical body, to preſerve and increaſe their internal and ſpiritual graces, and to depreſs the power of original ſin in them, as in others, to keep them in the ſaid poſture and right reception of the ſaid gift of eternal life; for ſaith the Text to the ſaid vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches, Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches; theſe words four times repeated, implies, That in theſe viſible Churches there were ſome whoſe ſpirits did hear and underſtand what the Spirit ſpake.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:179408:30"/>
            <p>And thus the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrived with the ſpirits of the eleven Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Mark 16.14.</note> which were inviſible Members, <hi>Judas</hi> being dead; for the Text ſaith, He appeared unto the eleven and upbraided them with their unbelief at another time: Thus ſtrives his Spirit with theirs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue in my love,
<note place="margin">John 15.9, 10.</note> if ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love.</p>
            <p>Another time thus the Spirit ſtrived with theirs, Oh faithleſs and perverſe generation,
<note place="margin">Mark 17.17.</note> how long ſhall I be with you, how long ſhall I ſuffer you: At another time thus the Spirit ſtrived with the ſpirit of <hi>Nathaniel</hi> to eſtabliſh him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid I ſaw thee under the Figg-Tree,
<note place="margin">John 1.50.</note> Believeſt thou? Thou ſhalt ſee greater things then theſe.</p>
            <p>Is is ſo, that Chriſts Spirit thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of all ſorts of men in the world? Hence obſerve, That all thoſe who have not yet received the gift of Faith, nor the gift of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and ſo do fall into eternal death, ſhall be left without excuſe in their own conſciences to eternity; becauſe it will witneſs to them that God would have given them both, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and if they had received it, then their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was of God, becauſe attained by his Son, given by himſelf: As alſo, Chriſt's Spirit thus ſtriving with their ſpirits, and therefore it will alſo witneſs that their deſtruction is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo Gods moſt ſweet righteouſneſs in this adminiſtration will ſhine to his glory in their ruine to eternity.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:179408:31"/>
            <p>Again, Is it ſo, that Chriſt's Spirit thus ſtrives with all men to cheriſh and increaſe the ſaid light of Chriſt in them, and to depreſs the ſeed of the Serpent in them, and that they are thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally meetly diſpoſed towards the ſaid poſture: Hence obſerve, it muſt needs follow, that all men which become totally dead in ſins and in treſpaſſes to that poſture, ſo as that they cannot change or alter their operations thereunto, no more then the Black Moor can change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots; I ſay, Hence obſerve, That all men that are thus dead in ſins and in treſpaſſes in the world, it ariſeth not from the ſeed of original ſin, but as an occaſion, and only from their cuſtom in ſin and wickedneſs, unto the acquired habits therein, as the cauſe, for it is cuſtom in any thing that brings another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it ſo, that the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrives with the ſpirits of all men to preſerve and repreſs, as is proved; Hence obſerve, That when God by Chriſts Spirit is pleas'd to inliven the ſpirits of ſome men to the ſaid poſture, which were dead in ſin and in treſpaſſes, and leaves other ſome in the ſame condition ſo to periſh: I ſay, hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That God in this caſe neither inlivens the one, nor leaves the other from love or hatred to either of them perſonally conſidered, but out of love to himſelf in purſuance of his final end; for thus he took up the Jews when they lay pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in their bloud, being <hi>Terah's</hi> Idolatrous brood, and ſaid they ſhould live, that is, in this poſture that they might receive his gift of life;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:179408:31"/>and that not for their ſakes, but for his own names ſake; and thus he had mercy upon ſome of the Gentiles in the fulneſs of time, that were dead in ſins and in treſpaſſes, that they might live in this poſture; and thus the Jews which have been dead in ſins and in treſpaſſes this ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, this Spirit of Chriſt will inliven their dead ſpirits, that ſo they ſhall or may receive the ſaid gift of life again; for in this ſenſe the gifts and callings of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are without repentance, that is, to call men, and thus to give them, as is ſaid, in purſuance of his ſaid final end.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it ſo, that the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrives with the ſpirits of all ſorts of men in the world, to preſerve and increaſe the one, and to ſuppreſs the other, as is proved. Hence obſerve, That all men which as yet have not the gift of faith, are to be carefull that they are faithfull in that little they have received, but eſpecially not to reſiſt this Spirit ſtriving with their ſpirits, as we ſee did <hi>Cain,</hi> the old world. <hi>Noah</hi>'s poſterity at <hi>Babel,</hi> as did <hi>Shems</hi> in <hi>Terah</hi>'s, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> Gods Elect the offspring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> leſt God denying them the gift of faith, and ſo his gift of life; For then in ſeeing they ſhall not ſee, and in underſtanding they ſhall not underſtand, and ſhall never truely nor rightly be able to ſee the things which do belong to their eternal peace.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it ſo, That this Spirit of Chriſts thus ſtrives with all men of the world, and alſo with all men in the viſible Churches of Chriſt, and alſo with the inviſible Members, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179408:32"/>then let them which think they have the true Spirit of faith in God, and love to God and their neighbour, kindled in their breaſts by this Spirit of Chriſts, beware they quench not the Spirits flame of love and firm faith by inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate cares and love of this worlds profits or pleaſurable luſts, leſt they having begun in the Spirit, doe end in the fleſh, and reap corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it ſo that the Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrives and effects in the hearts of the inviſible Members of Chriſts true faith and love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces, Then hence obſerve, That although in attaining eternal life they can do nothing, but in that Chriſt alone doth all; and alſo that in the gift of internal light of Chriſt, and in the gift of faith, and in the gift of other graces and in the increaſe and grouth of them, the inviſible members of Chriſt are meerly paſſive in all this; yet hence obſerve, That by the ſame ſpirit of faith and love, they are inabled to keep their hearts with care and diligence; ſo that no man or power ſhall take away their Crown of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and hope of glory; Firſt, becauſe in the ſaid gifts they have received the ſpirit of love, of power, and of a ſound mind in ſome degree, therefore they are able ſo to doe. A ſecond Reaſon is this, The Spirit of Chriſt is at hand when they ſo put forth that power they have, not only to aſſiſt them to keep their hearts in theſe endeavours, but alſo to add that wherein they are meerly paſſive, as I ſaid before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to add the increaſe of all theſe graces they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179408:32"/>have, and ſo they grow from ſtrength to ſtrength in Sion; and therefore they may, and are able to keep their hearts as is ſaid. And therefore ſaith our Lord, As I ſay unto all men, ſo I ſay unto you, Watch leſt ye enter into temptation.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I call the third in the one God, or the third Perſon in Trinity, the Spirit of Chriſt, is this, Becauſe that as all that the Father hath, is Chriſt's, in purſuance of this ſaid final end; ſo Chriſt by the third in the one Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, in Gods mercifull voice in the Creation, and moſt eminently, and moſt properly by the voice of the Goſpel in the tongue of man to man, by the Miniſtry of this Spirit, doth ſtrive with the ſpirits of all men to depreſs the mind of the Devil in them, and to implant the ſimilitude of the mind of Chriſt in them, which is mans ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in order to the Fathers will, to a right receiving of his ſaid righteouſneſs imputed to their eternal life, or to be either, as is proved.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>In which is handled the fifth branch of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdom of God precedently propounded, and the laſt ingredients which makes up the ſaid poſture, namely, that God by the ſeed of the woman immediately after the fall, gave a rule ſuitable to all men to work or operate by, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his ſaid final end.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Point divides it ſelf into three parts, two whereof are handled in this Chapter, the third in the next.</p>
            <p>The firſt declares unto all men who it is that Governs them by this Rule, for a Governor is imployed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is to let all men ſee what this Rule is.</p>
            <p>The third is, that all men may ſee how ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table this rule is unto them. Of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, Certainly he that reſtoreth all mankind out of the falne maſs of death, into the ſaid poſture, to receive the ſaid gift of life, he it is that governs man by his own Rule; and therefore ſaith man, believing truth, To us a Child is born, and to us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be laid upon his ſhoulders, and his name ſhall be called Wonderfull, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and the mighty God, and ſo forth. And ſaith the Lord himſelf,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 9.6.</note> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; and then goes on
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179408:33"/>governing all men in this Government by his Apoſtles, by the ſaid ſuitable rule;
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18, 19.</note> For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Mar. 16.16.</note> Goe ye therefore into all the world, and Preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that will not believe ſhall be damned. From this ground it is, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man, becauſe he committeth all judgement to the Son.
<note place="margin">John 5.22.</note> So much for the firſt Point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all men may ſee what this Rule is; And in a word, it is no more but this, namely, The Tenor of the Goſpel; and that is a Rule of Juſtice and Mercy; for the Goſpel it ſelf is one thing, and its Tenor is another; and the Goſpel it ſelf is no more but this, Gods higheſt mercy manifeſted by Chriſt to man, to relieve him out of his deepeſt miſery: Firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed immediately upon the fall,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Luke 2.10, 11.</note> when God ſaid unto the Serpent, The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe thy head. Secondly, In the fulneſs of time, when the Angel ſaid, Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy that ſhall be unto all people; that is, That unto you is born this day in the City of <hi>David,</hi> a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord: and the Goſpels Tenor is no more but this as is ſaid, A Rule of Juſtice and Mercy for all men to work by, and not a Rule of Juſtice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as was that to <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency before the fall, in purſuance of Gods ſaid final end.</p>
            <p>For proof of this Point, the Oracles of God manifeſted it, firſt in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> to <hi>Cain,</hi> although his operations were not well according
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:179408:34"/>to this rule, yet the mercy of it appeared to him after he had not done well, in this, That God interrogatively promiſed him acceptance, ſaying, If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; implying moſt certainly, Thou ſhalt, as is <hi>Abel</hi> thy brother. And in the next words appears the juſtice of this rule, If thou doſt not well, ſin lies at the dore.</p>
            <p>And as concerning <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were according to his poſture, the juſtice of this rule appeared to him, in that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved thereof, and the mercy of this rule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it admitted acceptance of him, although unperfect in the perfect operations of another man, as appears by his ſacrifices, which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the imputative righteouſneſs of Chriſt; for ſaith the Text,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>Abel</hi> offered unto God a more acceptable ſacrifice then <hi>Cain;</hi> by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained witneſs that he was righteous,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.4.</note> God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his gift, and ſo the ſame tenor of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and juſtice all along down the old world to the Flood, the mercy of it, when the wickedneſs of man is great on the earth by Apoſtacy from the ſaid poſture, and all ungodlyneſs; yet the mercy of this rule gave them time to repent and turn to the ſaid poſture to receive the ſaid gift of life, namely, one hundred and twenty years, in which time the long-ſufferings of God waited in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo alſo the juſtice of this rule of mercy brought in the flood upon the world of ungodly, and to <hi>Noah</hi> its juſtice and mercy were alſo both extended, as unto <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe he kept to the ſaid poſture in a conſtant
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179408:34"/>reception of the ſaid gift of life, for by faith he being warned of God of things which were not yet ſeen, moved with reverence, prepared the Ark to the ſaving of his houſhold, through which Ark he condemned the world, and ſo was made heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith; and the ſame tenor was alſo extended to <hi>Noahs</hi> poſterity after the flood, and none other: for as this juſtice ſcattered them from the Land of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> for their Apoſtacy from the ſaid poſture, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of all the earth, as is proved, ſo the mercy of this rule followed them eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years under that wrath of God, and none other, as in the tenth Chapter following will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and as in the ſeventh Chapter of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatiſe is proved; and this ſame Tenor, and none other was extended to the ſaid Nation elect in the loynes or ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it was figured in the Pot of Manna, and the Rod that budded, and the two Tables of the Moral Law, as joyntly incloſed in the Ark, and ſo a figure of the perfection of the ſatisfactory righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to the world, and therefore God named it his Mercies Seat, and ſo he ſpake from thence to that Nation as a part of all mankind, and the juſtice of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was figured to that Nation,
<note place="margin">In my former Treatiſe p. 70.</note> in the manner of the delivery of the Goſpel into the vail of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as in fire, in ſmoke, in earthquake, yet it was the juſtice of this mercifull Tenor, becauſe it was delivered on that Mount from God by an Angel into the hand of a Mediator, namely, <hi>Moſes</hi> in the type, which was Chriſt in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179408:35"/>truth; and therefore it is ſaid, the Law came by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but grace and truth by Ieſus Chriſt. That is, the grace and truth of all contained in thoſe Laws, came by Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo made up a Goſpel of glad tidings to that people, and all Nations: From this ground they had a daily ſacrifice for ſin in their generations, and this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor more clearly appears to that Nation; for God having ſtiled them the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he thus faith unto them, If the wicked will turn from his ſins that he hath committed,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20, 24.29.30.</note> he ſhall ſurely live; there is the mercy of this Tenor, If the wicked turn not, the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon himſelf: there is the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of this Tenor.</p>
            <p>Again, This ſame Tenor, and none other now, is when the Goſpel is unvailed, nor never ſhall to the worlds end; for all men ſtand bound to their believing operations in their ſaid poſture, to receive the ſaid gift of life, or to periſh, as witneſſeth our Lord in the fore-cited Text to the Apoſtles; Go ye into all the world and Preach the Goſpel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved: There is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Goſpels Tenor, He that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhall be damned: There is the juſtice of its Tenor.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. <hi>In which is proved that the Spirit of Chriſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the ſpirits of Noahs poſterity which were confounded and ſcattered at Babel in their ſucceeding Generations, to preſerve them in a narrow way to eternal life.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Point devides it ſelf into three parts; Firſt, that they had the truth of God to direct them to that way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That that truth was the truth of God to them in the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">1 Rom. 18.25, 26, 28.</note> That by this truth ſome of the beſt of them did attain eternal life, although the generality refuſed it, and ſo periſhed: Of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the truth of God they had is clear in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and the 18. becauſe the Spirit of Chriſt by <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them with, with holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs, and with turning that truth into a lie, and ſo forſaking the Creator which is bleſſed for ever, Amen, as verſe the 25. And for this cauſe God delivered them up from Chriſts Spirit, ſtriving with their ſpirits to vile affections, verſe 26. And the reaſon thereof is further amplified in the 28 verſe, namely, as they regarded not to acknowledg God in that truth they had, even ſo God delivered them up to a reprobate mind; therefore this truth of God
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:179408:36"/>the Heathens or Gentiles had, although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and ſcattered at <hi>Babel</hi> from the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Goſpel, and its Tenor with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this truth was the truth of God to them by the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt the Lord is clear alſo; and it was twofold, the one external, and the other internal: The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth was manifeſted and ſhewed to them by Chriſt the Lord, by the whole creation, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only firſt-born of every creature, as the ſecond Adam from the dead fall of Adam, for ſo he opened the womb of the whole creation in its tendency and travel from the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it then fell in to be partakers of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberties of the Sons of God, and that this travel of the Creation is a continued act by the force of Chriſt, as aforeſaid, is clear; for the Text ſaith, It travelleth untill now; yet here note by the way, That the continuation of the good things in Nature in the Creation, is not ſimply from Nature, by vertue of the Creation, as ſuch, for that was loſt in the fall, as is implyed in the Text; becauſe it ſaith, The Creation is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto vanity willingly, that is, by its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inſtinct, but by reaſon of God who cauſed the Creation to depend, firſt upon the operations of the firſt Adam; and then upon the ſecond Adams, as is implyed in the Text, namely, by reaſon of him who hath ſubdued the ſame in hope, from whence the earneſt expectation of the Creature or Creation waiteth for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Sons of God: Yet again, note this by the way, That although the Creation by

<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.9.</note> follows this concluſion.</p>
            <p>That the Voice, Language, or Speech of the whole Creation of good from God to man in all its force and effects by all creatures ever ſince Chriſt, was the firſt-born in the promiſe to break the Serpents head, is the general voice of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings of God to man, by Ieſus Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory righteouſneſs imputed; for we ſee its tendency and dependancy to bleſſedneſs hangeth only upon that; ſo that in a word, the whole Creation in general is the voice of the Goſpel; and that is the reaſon why in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Old, the voice of the Goſpel Preached by men is brought in, in a ſenſe, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one and the ſame thing to mankind; yet note that it is with this difference, The one a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and remote voice, and the other the more diſtinct and particular, as by Writings in the Oracles of God, and by the ſpeech and language
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:179408:37"/>of man to man by the word Preached; and thus <hi>David</hi> brings them in joyntly, ſaying, The heavens declare the glory of God, and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſhew his handy works, day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledg, there is no Speech nor Language where their voyce is not heard, their loyne is gone forth throughout all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world, in them he hath ſet a Tabernacle for the Son, and ſo forth: and then he joyneth the Goſpel thereunto in theſe words,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. from verſe 1 to 8. Note, The Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation began thus, to preach Chriſt from its firſt ſtep into this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel from the bondage of corruption, to be partakers of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberties of the Sons of God: and when that firſt ſtep began, you may ſee in my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, page the 35.</note> The Law of God is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſoul, the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, and giveth wiſdom unto the ſimple, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Lord are right, and rejoyce the heart, and ſo forth. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Preaching of the Goſpel, concludes, Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and then having ſpoken of Iews and Grecians in the 12 verſe, concluding, That be that is Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him; and then puts the Queſtion in the 18 verſe, ſaying, But I demand, Have they not heard? meaning the Grecians or Heathens as well as the Iews: and then he anſwers the queſtion, namely, That the Goſpel was heard by them in the ſaid words of the Pſalmes, No doubt their ſound went out throughout all the earth, and their words into the end of the world; implying, That both voices ought to be heard, and being rightly heard, they both breed vertually in the heart of man, faith in Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.12, 17, 18.</note> yet with this difference, the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and more weak, becauſe its voyce is but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:179408:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>general and remote, the other more clear and ſtrong, becauſe his voyce is more clear and near to the ſpirit of a man. So much for the external truth of God in Chriſt, by which Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtrived with their ſpirits to direct them in that narrow way to eternal life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The internal truth of God in Chriſt by which the Spirit of Chriſt ſtrived with the ſpirits of the ſaid confounded and ſcattered off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Noah</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> in a word, is no more but this, namely, The remainder of the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Law and light of Chriſt in their hearts for, as is proved, they were excluded the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Goſpel with them, as is implyed in the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. it ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.15.</note> The Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law, and are a Law unto themſelvs, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts: And this Law in the hearts of them all, if they had ſubmitted to this inward ſtriving of of the Spirit of Chriſt with their ſpirits, and not detained it in unrighteouſneſs, as they did, it would have produced the circumciſion of the hearts of them all; which is the true rectitude of the mind, or ſanctification, as it did to ſome of them which did in that little they had, ſeek to do well, and ſo it was effected in them, namely, Circumciſion, which is by nature, ſaith the Text, verſe 27. and in the 29 verſe, To be circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart and ſpirit, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. So much for the internal truth of God in Chriſt to direct the Heathens in the narrow way to life.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:179408:38"/>
            <p>But the Queſtion may be, What life that was that the beſt of thoſe Heathens did attain unto?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Neither more nor leſs, but the ſame eternal life which the believing Iews received by operations in Gods gift of Chriſts imputative righteouſneſs, as appears in the ſixth verſe, God will render every man according to his works, that is, To them which through a patient well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.6.7, 10.</note> ſeek for honour and glory, immortality, everlaſting life; and in the tenth verſe, To every man that doth good, ſhall be glory, and honour and praiſe, to the Iew firſt, and to the Grecian; for there is no reſpect of perſons with God, for to this hath our Lord Chriſt made his promiſe, They that ſeek ſhall find, and to him that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſhall be opened: From this ground it was that the Apoſtles were not aſhamed to Preach the Goſpel in Heatheniſh Rome to believers; his firſt reaſon is, Becauſe it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, to the Iew firſt, and alſo to the Grecian</p>
            <p>His ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe by it the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith, that is, from faith implicite, as moſt weak to faith more ſtrong and expreſſive, as formerly is proved.</p>
            <p>His third Reaſon is, Becauſe the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all unrighteouſneſs of men which withhold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for as much as that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them; for ſaith he, God hath ſhewed it unto them, namely, by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.19.</note> as aforeſaid; for that is here implyed.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:179408:38"/>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon why the Spirit of God thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of theſe Heathens and all men elſe, may be this, although it be all alike unto God in reſpect of his final end, whether the moſt or leaſt number of men be made veſſels of honour or diſhonour unto eternity, ſo all be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one or the other, becauſe by his mercifull and juſt proceedings in the ſuitable rule, his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a moſt ſweet righteouſneſs ſhineth forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in either to his praiſe; and yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in reſpect to man, it being his Creature,
<note place="margin">Acts 17. from 25. to 29.</note> his offsprings and generation, which as, ſaith the Text, he hath made of one blood, and under the aforeſaid univerſal election; yet in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God would rather man would as he ſhould and might according to this rule, and Chriſts Spirit ſtriving with his ſpirit, return by his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into the ſaid poſture, to receive the ſaid gift of life, and be bleſſed for ever: As I live, ſaith the Lord God,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.27.</note> I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his waies and live; when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> and doe that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon why the Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of theſe Heathens and all men, is, becauſe the Apoſtate Angels do uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally indeavour by their temptations, lies, and deluſions, to keep all mankind from receiving the ſaid gift of life, and therefore do endeavour not only to extinguiſh the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but alſo to extinguiſh and turn the internal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179408:39"/>light of Chriſt in all men into darkneſs, and if they could poſſible draw all men into eternal darkneſs; and their main end in all this is, that God might not have any glory in mans felicity to eternity; and therefore to repel this their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in that particular branch, it is that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt thus ſtrives with all men, and for this end we ſee the ſeed of the woman was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be Chriſt the Lord, and ſecond Adam; and for this end God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever by believing operations will receive the ſaid gift of life, ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life; for therefore we ſee God elected the falne Maſs of mankind out of that deſpicable eſtate into the ſaid poſture, as is proved; and alſo therefore we ſee that God elected one Nation to be, and to be in the ſaid poſture to carry on his ſaid final end, as it reſpected this particular branch, not for their ſakes, but for his own names ſake: and likewiſe we ſee to carry on this ſaid final end in this particular branch, He hath mercy upon whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth, when by their acquired habits in ſin againſt the ſaid poſture, they are all alike dead in ſin and treſpaſſes, I ſay not in love or hatred to any of theſe men perſonally conſidered, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love to himſelf, in the proſecution of this branch of his ſaid final end, as is proved, that he called the Gentiles to this poſture, but denied it at that time to the Iews, and ſo on this ſixteen hundred years, and that in purſuance of the ſaid branch, will call them to this poſture again, by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:179408:39"/>which they may receive the ſaid gift of life; and this is the ground why he precedently made ſo many glorious promiſes of calling the Gentiles, and alſo of the Iews according to his Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and from this cauſe only they are beloved for their Fathers ſakes, as is proved; and therefore it is that the Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrived with the ſpirits of theſe Heathens and all men elſe, as is proved.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon may be this, Becauſe the more men are brought by the ſtriving of Chriſts Spirit with their ſpirits to believing operations in this poſture by the reception of this gift of life in point of juſtification, the more fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs abounds alſo in their ſanctification in a redundancy to Gods glory againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels ſaid deſigne; and therefore it is that the Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrives, as with theſe Heathens, ſo with all men.</p>
            <p>The firſt Uſe is for Information, That if the Spirit of Chriſt thus ſtrives with the ſpirits of all mankind to bring them to, and to keep them in this poſture. Hence we learn two things; Firſt, That the ſtriving of this Spirit to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as is proved, is the univerſal favour of God in Ieſus Chriſt to all men in the world. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is this, That thoſe amongſt men which by believing operations, rightly receive the ſaid gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall muchmore receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhall reigne in life by one, namely, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that as ſin had reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reigne through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:179408:40"/>unto eternal life by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe is this, That God will never revoke that pardon of the guilt and puniſhment, namely, eternal death due to all mankind for Adams one offence; Firſt becauſe of his ſaid gift of life which came upon all men unto juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the imputative righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as is proved; for, for this end he gave the Spirit of Chriſt thus to ſtrive with the ſpirits of all men from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof, that they might receive the ſaid gift of life; therefore the pardon of the ſaid guilt and puniſhment due to all mankind for Adams one offence, ſtands irrevocable to eternity,—for ever ſince the fall this is the condemnation, now this light of life is come into the world, becauſe men love darkneſs rather then light.</p>
            <p>The third Uſe God is irrevocable in this Point alſo, namely, To give to any man the poſſeſſion of eternal life in this world by belief, and the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the next world, which is conſtant in his believing operations in the ſaid poſture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtriving of Chriſts Spirit with his ſpirit; for ſaith our Lord, He that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place this informs us alſo, That if any man be by God diſpoſſeſt of his eternal life in this world, and ſo in the next, it muſt needs follow, he quencheth this Spirit of Chriſt, which thus by belief gave him poſſeſſion of it here, and ſo would have done there, had he not perſiſted in quenching, and alſo in reſiſting the ſaid Spirit, by following lying vanities, and ſo forſaking his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:179408:40"/>own mercies, as did <hi>Demas,</hi> and the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> till God removed the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick from them, and left them in darkneſſe, and <hi>Demas</hi> to imbrace this preſent world.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, That the Goſpel and the Univerſe of this Creation has a tendency, and bends joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as one in mans univerſal good, and vertually to breed in him the faith of God in Ieſus Chriſt, as is proved.</p>
            <p>Then hence obſerve, That thoſe that ſtand in an univerſal relation to men, at the Stern of Magiſtracy as Gods, ſtand bound univerſally to further the good of man, not of this life only, but of that which is to come; namely, to ſet up in their Territories and Dominions, in all convenient places, the Preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to beget the belief of God in Ieſus Chriſt in the minds of men.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>In which is handled the third particular in the ſaid Rule, namely, to let all men ſee how ſuitabble this Rule is to them.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe ſuitableneſs whereof is opened in nine particulars; as firſt, It has its Inſtitution in Gods word of truth, and the natural property of the underſtanding of all men, being, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to follow truth as ſuch, or as it appears to be ſuch: wherefore we ſee the Apoſtate Angels came to our firſt Parents in the appearance of truth, therefore it is univerſally ſuitable to all mankind in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This rule tenders to man, not only a good to be received by his operations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, but alſo his ſweeteſt and chiefeſt good; namely, to enjoy God in belief of the truth in this life, and according to truth, to eternity in the next; and ſo this rule is ſuitable to mans will, whoſe natural property is to follow good, or as it appears ſo to be, as the natural property of the eye is to follow the light; wherefore the Apoſtate Angels came to us in our firſt parents, as is proved in appearance of a good; wherefore this rule is univerſally ſuitable to all men in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ever ſince the fall of Adam, God in his word requires no man by his workings to attain eternal life for himſelf or others, but only
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:179408:41"/>by his workings in the ſaid poſture to receive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, attained only by the Lord Chriſt, and given imputatively by God himſelf; therefore this rule is univerſally ſuitable to all men, none excepted but Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the natural liberty of mans will conſiſts in this, namely, to chuſe and refuſe all objects, as it likes them, or as it likes them not, as is proved. And becauſe this rule ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a twofold object to will or nill, that is, to chuſe or refuſe; namely, good or evil, that is, eternal life or death for it to chuſe or refuſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is univerſally ſuitable to all in this reſpect, none excepted.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, becauſe this juſt and mercifull rule ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits mercy to man after he hath not done well, according to his ſaid poſture, man being ever ſince the fall imperfect; therefore this rule is ſuitable univerſally to all men, none excepted but Chriſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Becauſe it is propper to all men which propound to themſelves an end in their workings, to ground thoſe workings and operations upon their own belief or faith of a good to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and attainable, as do Merchants which ſend or go by Sea or Land for wealth, or the like, or upon their own belief of ſome evil or danger, as did theſe Marriners, which to avoid the danger of death by their operations, caſt the wheat out of the Ship into the Sea; and therefore becauſe this rule requires mans own belief of Gods truth and the ſaid good, and to avoid the contrary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to be the ground of all their operations in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:179408:42"/>ſaid poſture, He that believes ſhall be ſaved, he that will not believe ſhall be damned, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Wherefore becauſe this Rule requires all men thus to make their own belief, as is ſaid, the ground of their operations in this poſture; therefore this rule is univerſally ſuitable to all men, none excepted but men that are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes by acquired habits herein, or ſots, idiots, mad men, or the like: From this ground it is that our Lord ſaith, This is the work of God, That ye believe, and ſo forth; and from this ground it is, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing operations in this poſture,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.4.</note> was ſo much reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as oppoſed to men that made their own works, as works in this poſture, to be the ground only of their acceptance with God to eternal life; and from this ground, namely, That man makes his own belief of Gods truth, and the ſaid good to be the ground of his operations in this ſaid poſture it is, that faith is ſo highly extol'd in Scriptures by the Spirit of Chriſt; for in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they render unto God the ſole glory of all his truth and goodneſs revealed in the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt the Lord, and his imputed righteouſneſs, and Gods gift of life therein.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Becauſe mans reaſonable ſoul or ſpirit is of an everlaſting duration, and never to be extinct, and mans body when raiſed a ſpiritual body, ſo to be alſo; and becauſe this rule tenders to man an eſtate of well and woe, of an everlaſting duration, and that all things elſe under the Sun, are only ſuitable to his moldring body, and to a change, as alſo is it; therefore
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179408:42"/>this rule is univerſally ſuitable to all men in this reſpect, none excepted.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Becauſe this rule not only admits man to do well after he hath done evil, as is ſaid; but when he ſo returns, admits pardon of the guilt and puniſhment due to him for his ſin or ſins, as is proved; therefore this rule is ſuitable to all men capable to operate to this rule, Chriſt only excepted, in whom was no ſin.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Becauſe God hath given an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and dictate of the effect of this rule, as it reſpects its execution in reference to his final end, in the minds of all men naturally; namely, that he will render unto all men according to their works; and from this ground it is, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all men do either excuſe or accuſe them, according to their own works, good or bad, the which is the dictate of this rule, and Gods ſaid final end, as is ſaid; therefore this rule is univerſally ſuitable to all men, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>From the Premiſſes thus proved ariſeth theſe following Obſervations; Firſt, That this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as carrying along in it this Tenor, a juſt and a mercifull rule is it which all mankind are under to work by, in relation to their eternal ſtate, and none other, as is proved: Hence ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, The Goſpel was Preached unto us as to them, meaning to us in the laſt daies as to the Jews, and unto all in former ages before them; wherefore not any of mankind ſince the fall ever was, or now is, nor never ſhall be under a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, properly ſo called, the Lord
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179408:43"/>Chriſt only excepted; therefore it is a miſtake to affirm that all men which are not true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are under a Covenant of works, and wrath of God, and out of the grace and favour of God in Chriſt: For we ſee proved at large, that the favour of God in Chriſt pardoned to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind eternal death due to them for Adams one offence, and that every man is born with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal light of Chriſt in him, and hath reduced the total nature of ſin to a ſeed, and alſo God hath given the Spirit of Chriſt to ſtrive with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all men, to keep that ſeed of original ſin from the acquired habits, if men will be faithfull in their little, and to increaſe the internal light of Chriſt in them, and to bring them to, and to keep them into the ſaid poſture, that they may receive his gift of life in Chriſt: therefore it muſt needs follow that the former Doctrine is a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it ſo, That this Rule, the Goſpel Tenor, is the only and alone ſuitable rule for all men to work in reference to their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Then hence obſerve. If any man deſires or expects union with God in point of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it muſt only be by his works in the ſaid poſture, becauſe only by the reception of the ſaid gift of life wrapt up in Chriſts righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, man comes to God the fountain of life; for ſo Chriſt is only the way, the truth and the life; therefore thoſe fantaſtick men which dream of an union with the Divine Eſſence, have an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed, but not in their ſenſe; for only this union they have, namely, That they live, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179408:43"/>move, and have their being in God, as have all creatures, as ſuch, and ſo have the Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the damned in hell, but not that union which they dream of; namely, an Union in the Divine Eſſence, eſſencially the ſame nature, and therefore as they reject all Ordinances, ſo their operations in this poſture, according to the ſaid ſuitable rule; and yet the Text which affirms we are partakers of the Divine Nature, ſhews wherein it conſiſts, namely, by operations and workings according to this rule, to ſuppreſs the effects of the ſeed of original ſin; for ſaith the Text, We are partakers of the Divine Nature, in that we fly the corruptions that are in the world through luſts, and this ſin and luſts we came to know by the Law, that is, the Goſpel, which was once under a vail; for ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, I had not not known ſin, except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not luſt: Now the ground of this blaſphemous error is this, Theſe men fancie to themſelves, that the Creation is eternal, that is, without beginning or end, and themſelves being a part thereof, are therefore eternal, yea God himſelf, all which is contrary to the teſtimonies of the ſacred Oracles of God; for it poſitively affirms the world had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it ſhall have an end, and God will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſacred Oracles, as he ſhaketh the wicked out of the corners of the earth, as Iobe ſpeaks, ſo will he ſhake and make theſe men veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of diſhonour in torments to eternity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the juſtice of this rule of mercy which they now deſpiſe, and he will laugh when their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:179408:44"/>fear cometh, to their deſtruction, if they return not in to the work of the ſaid poſture in time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all men beware of theſe mens fancies, and what God ſaies in his word, we muſt believe it, or elſe do worſe; for the Scripture ſpeaks in this tone to man from God, Thus ſaith the Lord, as did the Prophets in old time, implying, what God ſaies in his word, we muſt believe it, and ſo reſt; and if we believe the Lord and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, we ſhall ſurely proſper.</p>
            <p>Again, thirdly, Is it ſo, That this is the only rule ſuitable to all men, as is proved; hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, This Rule points us unto a twofold righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, The firſt is the rectitude of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intentions, and external operations, by the force of which man rightly receives the ſaid gift of life, and this righteouſneſs is called in Scripeure, Sanctification. The ſecond righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is this, When man by the ſaid rectitude hath believingly received Gods gifts of Chriſts righteouſneſs imputed; and becauſe in that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is included life eternal,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> and acceptance with God, therefore this righteouſneſs ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is called our juſtification; Therefore let no man preſume to be acceptable with God for his own operations in the ſaid poſture that is for works, as works, as did the Jews before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; for if we do, it is true, we may rejoyce in our ſelves, but not in God, no more then could <hi>Abraham</hi> if he had been of this opinion, as the Apoſtle affirms.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is it ſo, That God makes all men good or bad, according to their works, veſſels
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179408:44"/>of honour or diſhonour, as is proved, and as will more appear in the next Chapter: Then hence obſerve, That the abſolute power and ſoveraign pleaſure of the infinite God, in reducing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature to its final end to eternity, as the Potter makes one veſſel to honour, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſhonour of the ſame lump, he doth it only and alone by this rule, ſo ſuitable to all man kind, according to their works, and not by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobation perſonally conſidered upon man, as is rendred by reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> in theſe words, Not mans undeſervings is the cauſe of mans reprobations, but the will of God to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; the which Point the Scripture ſpeaks not, and we ſee it proved, that thus to ſhape men as is thus deſcribed, is Gods final end, beyond which there is none, for,
<note place="margin">Calvins inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the Margent p. 462.</note> for this end he made all things for his glory, as we ſee proved; he made the whole world and all its parts for this, and he ordained and elected the Lord Chriſt the ſeed of the woman, to carry on and accompliſh this his final end, as is proved.</p>

            <p>ANd firſt, Cain was the firſt man without the Church, from the time he departed from Adams Family, the firſt viſible Family-Church of Chriſt in the world; and in reference to this Point,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.14.16.</note> the Text ſaith, Cain went forth from the preſence of Jehovah; and ſaith Cain to him, From thy face ſhall I be hid; and ſaith the Text, Cain was of that wicked one, and ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and wherefore ſlew he him? The Text anſwers, Becauſe his own works were evil and his brothers righteous; wherefore the Spirit of Chriſt by Jude,
<note place="margin">2 Epiſt. Joh. 3.12. Jude, ver. 7.</note> concludes the execution of the juſtice of the ſaid Rule upon Cain, as upon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam and Corah, and ſo a veſſel of diſhonour for ever; conſequently thus God executed his final end upon thoſe of the old world, who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> that is, which were not of the Family-Churches of the firſt ten Fathers before the Flood; for the Text ſaith, God ſpared not the old world, and brought in the Flood upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:179408:45"/>the world of ungodly; and the like execution after the Flood on men without the Church, namely, Noah's poſterity,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.11, 12.</note> when they became Heathens upon their confounding and ſcattering at Babel; for of them the Text ſaith, As many as have ſinned without Law, ſhall periſh without Law, and God will render to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deeds: Conſequently thus this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution doth and ſhall proceed upon men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church to the worlds end. So much for thoſe without the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the viſible Church, God declared this execution impartially unto Cain when he was a member of the viſible Church, when he ſaid unto him, If thou doſt well, Shalt thou not be accepted: meaning, as is Abel thy brother; implying, Yea, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou ſhalt; But if thou doſt not well, ſin lies at thy dore: And accordingly the juſtice and mercy of this Rule was executed upon Abel; for becauſe his operations were Right in belief,
<note place="margin">Heb 11.4.</note> therefore according to the juſtice of this Rule, God rewarded his labour of love by mercy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him into glory in the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Son; both which is implyed in the Text, which ſaith, By faith Abel offered unto God a more acceptable ſacrifice then Cain, and obtained witneſs that he was righteous, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thus the Lord proceeded in execution in the Families of the ten Fathers before the Flood; and it is implyed <hi>Geneſis</hi> the fixth, in that he took ſpecial notice of their degeneration from their operations to him in their poſture to amity with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179408:46"/>the world, in that the Text ſaith, The Sons of God ſaw the daughters of men, that they were fair, and took them wives of all which they choſe; for thus did God when there was but one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Church of Chriſts left, and that was Noahs; for ſaith God to him, Come thou and thy houſe into the Ark, for thee have I ſeen righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in this generation, that is, Thee only; for that is implyed. Again, this execution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus upon the Family-Churches of Chriſt after the Flood, as is implyed in the eleventh of Geneſis: For there, all that did apoſtate at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and were ſcattered from being a viſible Church of Chriſt, their names are wholly left out in the Genealogy of Noah in that Chapter, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this execution had cut them off, and left them in the vanity of their minds to periſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few of them, which did ſeek ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory in that narrow way to eternal life, as before is proved; but the contrary it implies, the mercy of this rule was executed upon Shems Family-Church of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Gen. 11.10. to verſe laſt.</note> which kept to this poſture, and ſo were preſerved to be veſſels of honour, as is implyed in this, that Shems Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their names are all upon Record, their births, their lives, their deaths, written as it were in the book of life.</p>
            <p>Again, thus this impartial execution proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the next viſible Church which ſprang out of Terah's idolatrous brood, namely elect in Abrahams ſeed, then unborn, to be a viſible national Church of Chriſt, as before is proved; and of this Church the Text doth ſay, Although
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:179408:46"/>the number of the children of Iſrael be as the ſand on the Seas ſhore, a remnant ſhall be ſaved, for God will finiſh the work, and cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs, that is, according to this righteous rule of juſtice and mercy; and therefore when the generality of that people did degenerate by undervaluing the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which as to us, ſo to them was the righteouſneſs of God, in which was included life and glory for them by overvaluation of their own works and operations in that poſture they were in, by this they brought on the execution of the juſtice of the ſaid rule of mercy, as is implyed in the Text, which ſaith, They ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, and they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſtone, they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God; and thus they fell by degrees under the execution of Gods ſaid final end, this ſixteen hundred years, and now are to this day no viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Again, the next viſible Churches of Chriſt to this, were thoſe under the New Teſtament, and were choſen and elected into thoſe Churches by a new way, as never none was before, that is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of believers, according to the judgement of charity, and not mixt of believers and undbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as it was in the ſaid Family-Churches from the beginning, now as in the Jewiſh Churches to the times of the Goſpel, and the ſaid admittance into the Church as believers only under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel unvailed, is implyed in the words of our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179408:47"/>Lord in his great Commiſſion:
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.12. Rev. 2.7. And as more may appear at large in c. 2, 3.</note> He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and is baptized, that is, he that believeth and is received into the Church by Baptiſm, is in the Ark of ſalvation: and God executes his final end by the ſaid juſt and mercifull rule as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works to eternity, as appears in thoſe Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches of Aſia, in that the Lord Chriſt takes ſpecial notice of their good works and their bad; to their good works in the ſaid poſture, he makes gracious promiſes and incouragements, as that he will give them a Crown of life, and ſo forth; and for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral evil works, many grievous threatnings, among the reſt, to remove their Candleſtick of light and life in him, and ſo to leave them in darkneſs, as veſſels of diſhonour for ever, that is, to be no Churches of his.</p>
            <p>Again, thus God executes his final end by the juſtice and mercy of the Goſpels Tenor upon the inviſible members of Chriſts myſtical body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, good or bad, ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour for ever; for Paul ſpeaking of theſe men as of himſelf, ſaith, We walk by faith, and not by ſight; implying, they were the inviſible members of Chriſt, which walk not by ſight only, as do thoſe which are only viſible members: Wherefore we labour, ſaith he, being preſent or abſent, we may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him. And in the next words he gives a reaſon why they do ſo,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16, 17.</note> namely, We muſt all appear before the judgement Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179408:47"/>body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad; and in reference to this point, ſaith God himſelf, When a righteous man turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away from his righteouſneſs and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them, for his iniquity that he hath done ſhall he die;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.9, 10.</note> and therefore ſaith God unto the Prophet, Thou Son of man, ſay unto the children of thy people, The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the righteous ſhall not deliver him in the day of his tranſgreſſion, and for the wickedneſs of the wicked, he ſhall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedneſs, neither ſhall the righteous be able to live for his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, in the day that he ſinneth:
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.26.</note> And in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this point, to theſe inviſible members,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.12.</note> the Apoſtle ſaith, Know ye not that ye are the Temples of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you; if any man deſtroy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy, for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is holy, which Temple ye are, let no man deceive himſelf, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Again, in reference to this Point the Lord Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks to his eleven Apoſtles which were inviſible members; alſo for John 13.10, 11. when he had ſaid, Ye are clean, but not all, for he knew who ſhould betray him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, ſaith the Text, Ye are not all clean; but when Iudas was gon forth from them, verſe 30. then in the fifteenth Chapter and third verſe; Now, ſaith he unto them, ye are clean through the word which I have ſpoken unto you, that is, your hearts are purified by belief and love to me; thereupon ſaith he, Abide in me, and I in you, as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:179408:48"/>the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.
<note place="margin">Joh. 13.10, 11.30. Joh. 15.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10.</note> And ſaith he, I am the Vine, he that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; and yet in the next words he tels them, Their evil works will bring them to be veſſels of diſhonour for ever, ſaying, If a man abide not in me; he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them and caſt them into the fire, and they are burnt; implying, And ſo ſhall you, if ye abide not in me: But on the contrary, If they rightly operate in the ſaid poſture, they ſhall be veſſels of honour for ever; ſaying, If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what ye will, and it ſhall be done unto you, herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples; that is, ye ſhall continue ſo for ever; for they were his Diſciples before: And ſaith he, If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and abide in his love, that as I abide for ever in his love, ſo ſhall you, if ye keep my Commandments, or otherwiſe not; for that is implyed. Thus we ſee that God executes his final end upon the inviſible members of Chriſt, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, as to all men elſe.</p>
            <p>Again, That the full conſummation and final execution of this final end ſhall fall in at the great day,
<note place="margin">Jude 6. Joh. 11.24.</note> as Iude cals it, and the day of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Marcha cals it; And then the Sea and the Grave ſhall render up their dead, and then ſhall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179408:48"/>every man, ſaith the Text,
<note place="margin">Rev. 20.13. John 5.19.</note> be judged according to his works, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of damnation, and before him ſhall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd his ſheep from the goats, and he ſhal ſet the ſheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left; then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand, Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my Father,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.33, 34 41, 46.</note> inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world; then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on his left hand, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, and theſe ſhal go into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righterous into life everlaſting: So upon this laſt and final exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Gods final end, then cometh the end, when Chriſt ſhal have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to God, even the Father, when he ſhal have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power, that is, all Authority, Rule and Power, raiſed in a world of ungodly men by the Apoſtate Angels deluſive lies and temptations againſt the truth of Gods ſaid final end in the foreſaid particular branch; for till then Chriſt muſt reigne,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24, 25, 28.</note> as it is in the next words, untill he hath put down all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet, implying, and no longer in this Government, by his Spirit ſtriving in the Goſpel and its Tenor, a juſt and merciful Rule, as is implyed in the 28 verſe, when all things ſhal be ſubdued unto him, then ſhal the Son himſelf be ſubject unto him that did put all things under
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:179408:49"/>him: yet it is one thing that this Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6. Pſal. 45.6.</note> as ſuch, ſhal ceaſe for ever, as we ſee it ſhal, and another thing that the perſonal union in Chriſt God-Man ſhal ceaſe, for that ſhal never be, for ſo he is and ever ſhal be above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they ſhal worſhip him for ever, as it is written, Thy Throne is for ever O God, and ſo forth, and let all the Angels of God worſhip him, and ſo ſhal he be worſhiped of all the glorified Saints for ever; for if by the Angels, much more by them, notwithſtanding he is their head, and they members of his triumphant body, yet he as head and members, ſhal, as is ſaid before, be ſubject to God the Father in this reſpect, for as there was a time when Chriſt ſhould have the preheminence in all things for the proſecution of his Fathers final end; ſo now that end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attained, and time ſhal be no more. Now God muſt have the preheminency to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>In which is proved, how God ordained and executed his final end upon all the Angels to their final ends for ever, according to their works, ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the proſecution of this Point, I will briefly touch theſe ſix particulars, Firſt, That ſome of them God elected; ſecondly, That ſome of them he rejected; Thirdly lay down the ground of that rejection; Fourthly, That they tranſgreſſed Gods Law; Fifthly, lay down what that Law was; Sixthly, I will lay down the ground why God elected the other Angels, and to what they were elected more then they had together with the reſt before any fel; of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Text affirms that ſome of them are elected,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.21.</note> as appears by Pauls charging Timothy before the Elect Angels: therefore ſome of them are elected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The others were rejected from the good that the other were elected to, to an evil equivolent contrarily; for the Text affirms, That God caſt them down to hel, that is, when the reſt remained in heaven, and delivered them, ſaith the Text, into Chains of darkneſs to be reſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement; and Iude ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iud. v. 6.</note> God hath reſerved them in an everlaſting Chain under darkneſs unto the judgement of the great day; and our Lord ſaith, For them is prepared everlaſting fire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Angels ſtand rejected by God for ever from the ſaid good, to the contrary evil.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:179408:50"/>
            <p>Thirdly, The ground of that rejection is nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fore-cited Texts; namely, ſin; for the Text ſaith, God ſpared not the Angels that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; alſo Iude ſaith, thoſe Angels kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation; and our Lord points out the ſame: For when he had ſaid the Devil was a murtherer from the beginning, he alſo ſaith, and abode not in the truth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground of their rejection was ſin.
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, if they ſinned, as we ſee it is proved, this muſt needs follow,
<note place="margin">1 Ep. Joh. 3, 4. Rom. 5, 13.</note> a law they had, which they tranſgreſſed; For, as ſaith the Text, ſin is not imputed where there is no Law: and our Lord himſelf implyes, They ſtood bound by a Law to worſhip God their maker as they are his crreatures; therefore ſaid he to the Devil, It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve; and therefore a Law they had, for it is propper to God only to be without Law,
<note place="margin">Luk. 4.8.</note> who is without limits in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and therefore ſo in his operations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in a word, the Law they had and tranſgreſſed, was no more but this, namely, The Law of Nature, that is, their nature and exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which they had received from their maker, bound them, and by an innate principle called upon them by their operations in flames of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning love in all their ſtrength to worſhip and ſerve him, ſo to return him the ſole glory of all that they had received from him; for from this ground our Lord alleadged the ſame Law that God gave to man againſt them, becauſe they were his creatures, aſwell as man, ſaying, It is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179408:50"/>written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve; and we all know Gods Law written in mans heart, and in Gods Law, is one and the ſame thing in kind, yet with this difference in man imperfect, otherwiſe man could not do the things by nature contained in the Law, having not the Law, as before is proved.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The ground why, and to what God elected them that ſtood, to more then what they had together with the reſt, before they fell, was this:
<note place="margin">Job 4.18.</note> Before the fall they were all alike unſtable in that eſtate, according to that in Iob, he found not ſteadfaſtneſs in his Angels; the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the contingent events that might ariſe to them all, being included in the natural liberty of their will, from whence they all alike might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or chuſe to give their maker his glory due unto him, or might chuſe or refuſe to aſſume his glory unto themſelves, becauſe the natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the will in Men and Angels, conſiſts in this as is ſaid, namely, to chuſe or refuſe all objects, as it likes, or as it likes them not: therefore their eſtate ſtood all alike contingent for the future to ſtand in it, or to fall from it: Therefore becauſe theſe Angels did voluntarily refuſe to aſſume Gods glory to themſelves, and did chuſe to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole glory of all they had, to him in all their ſtrength; therefore this was the ground why God elected them, for as certainly as God rejected the others for rejecting his glory due unto him, as is proved, ſo certainly he elected theſe Angels to an eſtabliſhment in their choice, namely, ſo to render him glory to eternity, as a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179408:51"/>reward of their labour of love; conſequently to be bleſſed to eternity, becauſe they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſo to do, as did the others: Thus God did render to all the Angels according to their works, good or bad, ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour, and ſo accompliſhed his final end on them all to eternity.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this final execution hath thus paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them all, it follows, That as the rejected Angels can never will to render glory to God, as once they might before they abuſed it, becauſe by the juſtice of that execution, God doth deny them any influence or efflux from him to them, to convey or continue any good in them more then to be, that they may eternally be, to be eternally miſerable; ſo on the contrary by the ſame exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution there flows a continual influence from God to the elect Angels, to keep and ſupport them in the ſaid choice, to render him his ſole glory to eternity, which indeed is their bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever: for the ſervice of God is perfect freedom to men and Angels.</p>

               </label> If the workings of men and Angels be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe to God thus to reject or elect them, then the moving cauſe is not in or from God himſelf, but from cauſes extrinſical, which cannot be.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is true, and ſo it is in this caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was moved to work all things, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, but after the councel of his own will, as he purpoſed in himſelf, that is, to propound this his final end, and all the means ſuitable to accompliſh it, from whence iſſued
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179408:51"/>forth the Creation of men and Angels in their natural liberty of their will; that ſo the events of the operations of men and Angels might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, that from thence might ariſe their works, good and bad, and accordingly to be elected or rejected, ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour; therefore the moving cauſe was and is in God himſelf, to carry on and accompliſh his final end by his own means, as is deſcribed. Hence we may inform our ſelves aright of two things.</p>

               </label> Firſt, What it is that is Gods great decree upon which all things depend, in which he is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably unchangeable, that is, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed this final end, and all the ſaid means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it; for we ſee for this end he created the Heavens and the Earth with all therein, and both in relation to men and Angels: and to carry on this end, we ſee he elected and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt the Lord, the ſecond Adam; the ſeventh means to carry on this final end.</p>
            <p>Secondly; We may hence inform our ſelves that God made not the heaven of heavens for Angels ſakes, although it be their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor this world for mans ſake, although it be with all therein related to mans uſe and good; I ſay he made it not for mans ſake, but all for his own names ſake, in reference to his final end; and it muſt needs be ſo, for we ſee it prov'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects no mans perſon more then another in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this his final end, be they men without the Church, or be they men within the Church,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:179408:52"/>Saints by calling, or Saints indeed; and in truth ſuch, if they abide not ſo, are by God judged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, ſome to honor, and ſome to diſhonor, as are all ſorts of men, for he made all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yea the wicked for the day of evil; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is moſt righteous in all this, not only becauſe he wils it, but alſo becauſe he wils it thus to men and Angels, by the ſaid ſuitable rules, and not according to the forementioned miſtake of many reverend, learned, and godly men.</p>

               </label> I anſwer, Puniſhments with us men reſpect not time, but according to the nature and degree of the fact; for we by our Laws take away this life which now men have, for facts done in a ſhort time, and that life ſo taken away, is loſt to them, as now it is to eternity, and yet we judge this fact a juſt puniſhment, if for theft or murder, or the like, then much more is the righteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of God to proceed thus with men and Angels; but as for that fact of Angels, it was moſt tranſcendent, Firſt becauſe they volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily left their firſt eſtate, as not liking it; and the reaſon why they ſo did, is in the Text, that is, They were puffed up, that was to be above what God had made them, althoughed the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt created nature, and ſo next to the uncreate and unmeaſurable eſſence of God, therefore they being puffed up, their ſin was, they would have been he, becauſe between him and them there

            <p>ANd whereas it appears from proof, that God hath paſſed upon man a fivefold Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Rejection in proſecution of his final end in reſpect to their eternal eſtate.</p>
            <p>The firſt being out of the faln Maſs; from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with Devils into the ſaid poſture.</p>
            <p>The ſecond being a continued act of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by electing and rejecting two Nations, the one to be Chriſts viſible Church, the other not, being but vertually in the loynes of two babes, their being but individually in their mothers womb unborn.</p>
            <p>A third being when God electeth and rejecteth men which by their acquired habits in ſin, are both alike dead in relation to Chriſt, for then we ſee he chuſeth to inliven the minds of ſome, and denies it to the others, as he did to us Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and denied it to the Jews at that time.</p>
            <p>A fourth election and rejection being that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Chriſt by the viſible Churches on earth, chuſing or receiving into the Churches men which according to the judgement of charity are believers, and rejecting or refuſing men which cannot be judged in charity to be believers, for in this caſe,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.3.14.</note> although many are called by the Goſpel, yet few are choſen, becauſe few believe.</p>
            <p>A fift being the conſummation of the precedent elections and rejections in the final execution of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179408:54"/>his ſaid end at the day of judgement, by making all men veſſels of honour or diſhonour to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to their works, good or bad; and as for any other elections or rejections upon man in relation to their final eſtate to eternity, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks it not.</p>
            <p>And from the Premiſſes thus proved, it appears there is no perſonal election of any man from Gods foreſight of their faith or works, nor any perſonal election or rejection, meerly perſonal without reſpect to works, good or evil, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the councel of his own will, as he purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf, that is, to finiſh his ſaid final end by thoſe ſeven means formerly proved, under which fals in the fivefold elections and rejections, and none other.</p>
            <p>But if it be objected, If there be not an election perſonal in any of the twofold reſpects, then by reaſon of the natural liberty of mans will, Gods glory of his grace in Jeſus Chriſt to eternity, ſtands contingent, may fail and fall, and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, and deny that the ſtreſs and weight of the glory of Gods grace in Chriſt any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the natural liberty of mans will, but the ſtreſs and weight thereof relies upon an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means, namely, the foreſaid ſeventh means, It ſhal bruiſe thy head, that is, infallibly; and from this ground this ſeventh means was by the depth of Gods wiſdom compoſed, perſonally God-Man; and therefore the ſtreſs of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Chriſt, depended not upon the natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Chriſts humane will, but upon his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:179408:55"/>operations; and accordingly in that perſon the falne humane nature of man, aſcended the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory above the Angels; and ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels chief deſigne in the ſaid branch was deſtroyed, if no more of the falne nature of man had aſcended the Angels glory</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, The ſtreſs and weight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of depends not upon the natural liberty of mans will, becauſe ſo much of the falne nature of man which departs this life in infancy, or the like, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends the heavenly glory alſo, notwithſtanding the ſeed of original ſin that is in them, becauſe the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs upon the world, did interpoſe the imputation of Adams unrighteouſneſs upon the world, and ſo is the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world, as is proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, the ſtreſs and weight of the glory of Gods grace in Chriſt in man, having the uſe of his underſtanding, dependeth not upon the natural liberty of his will; but the ſtreſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dependeth upon the Spirit of Chriſt, ſtriving with mans ſpirit in the Goſpel; for if thoſe men periſh by the abuſe of the natural liberty of their wils, quenching and reſiſting this Spirit, ſo ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they put away this eternal life, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs God has the glory of his grace in Chriſt in their deſtruction, becauſe no man ſince the fall is condemned by a Law of works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch, but by the juſtice of the Law of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, namely, the Goſpel Tenor, or Rule of mercy and juſtice, as before is proved: From this ground the Miniſters of the Goſpel are the ſweet ſavour unto God in Jeſus Chriſt in them that periſh.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:179408:55"/>
            <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, The glory of Gods grace depends not upon the natural liberty of mans will, but upon the univerſal favour of God to man in Chriſt; for had thoſe that are periſhed been faithfull in the ſaid little which he in Chriſt hath given them, then he would have given them more and more, even to his gift of faith rightly to receive Chriſt; and in that faith have given them three degrees, that is, from babes to young men, and Fathers in Chriſt; and in the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he would have confirmed them in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with himſelf by Chriſt; that nothing ſhould be able to ſeparate them from him, nor him from them, in that bleſſed union and communion: And becauſe God was thus real towards them, the glory of his grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds eternally to his praiſe; for it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that their deſtruction is of themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glory of Gods grace ſtands ſtable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in Chriſt, notwithſtanding the liberty of mans will, and its contingent events.</p>
            <p>And for concluſion, take theſe following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In regard God created the natural li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mans will, purpoſly to be one means to his ſaid final end, that from the contingency of its events, mens works might be good or bad, ſo to be rendred veſſels of honour or diſhonour to eternity; therefore that opinion of both thoſe perſonal elections, and that of perſonal rejection falling point-blank to croſs this means, or to make it of no uſe, muſt needs be a great miſtake.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hence obſerve, That although the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179408:56"/>Spirit of Chriſt ſtrives, as is ſaid, with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all men in all places of the world, that it taketh up his dwelling place only in the heart or ſpirit of man when he is a right believer, and not before.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> I anſwer, firſt, Although the infinite Eſſence of God is not contained in the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that he was pleaſed for a time to take up his dwelling place only in the Temple in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lem, and in no place elſe in all the world, even ſo he was pleaſed to take up his dwelling place in the Humane Nature bodily, in the perſon of Chriſt, and ſo in no humane nature beſides; of this the ſaid Temple was a figure; wherefore he ſaid to the Iews, Deſtroy this Temple, and I will raiſe it, and ſo forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, This Temple alſo was a figure that God would take up his dwelling place in the hearts of true believers only; and in a word, this dwelling in the Temple, and in Chriſt himſelf, and in the hearts of his members, is no more but this, his abiding reſidence in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of himſelf in a peculiar preſence of his love and favour, as in the Temple more then in any peculiar place in all the world, and moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in Chriſts humane body, more then in any created nature, as is proved, and his dwelling in the hearts of believers, is a ſecret and ſilent manifeſtation of himſelf to their minds, and is ſo reſtrained to them, as it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179408:56"/>once was to the Temple at Jeruſalem, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Text ſays to believers, if they deſtroy this Temple in themſelves, God will deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>Again, Obſerve that Gods dwelling place as perſonally conſidered, is only in the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt; therefore Chriſt alone is perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Gods Elect for this end: ſo to be the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth means, therefore to affirm that any part of humane Nature, beſides that in his perſon, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally Gods Elect to eternal life, is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why God thus dwells in the hearts of no men elſe in al the world, is this; becauſe they are Regenerated only, and their belief or faith the principal part thereof, is that, by which Chriſt dwelleth in their hearts, as ſaith the Text, Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith, ſo that the truly ſanctifyed mind is Chriſts only habitation of all mankinde.</p>
            <p>A Second Reaſon why Chriſt thus dwells on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the hearts of Believers by Faith, is this; becauſe where this Sanctification or Holineſs is not, there is no proper place for him to manifeſt himſelf there, as is ſaid; for all men elſe that are, by being faithful in their little, are but coming towards Chriſt or God, by the ſaid ſtriving of his Spirit; that ſo, he might give them Faith, but yet having it not, there is no dwelling place for him, and for all ſorts of men in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they are dead in ſins, and in treſpaſſes, their Light being turned into Darkneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children of the Devil, and then what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath Chriſt with Belial?</p>

And therefore becauſe they are not faithful in their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they precedently had received, whereby they might in ſome degree have been brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Right Faith, and received Gods gift thereof, and alſo the ſaid gift of life by it, is that ſo few are ſaved. For from this ground it was that Chriſt could not do no great works amongſt them to whom he preached in his own perſon, and ſo by a demonſtrative force ſtrengthning the ſtriving of his ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Mark. 6.5, 6.</note> by his Doctrine upon their ſpirits. For the Text implies, it was becauſe of their unbelief; that is, of what they might have believed from that light which formerly they had received, as we ſee proved by thoſe heathens which had not the Oracles of God, yet being faithful in their little, by the aſſiſtance of Chriſts Spirit ſtriving with their ſpirits, were brought to Circumciſion of the heart, which as ſaith the Text, is by Nature, and were ſaved, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:179408:57"/>
            <p>The ground why Chriſts Spirit can do no great works to ſuch men as is ſaid is this, he will not croſs the orderly means to his fathers final end, namely not to force the Will of man, for then the nature of the Will is deſtroyed, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Reaſonable Soul annihilated, which muſt not be in reſpect of Gods final end, for ſo God ſhould deſtroy that means purpoſely made by himſelf, that man might be made to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or diſhonor, as is proved, and therefore No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah by the ſpirit of propheſie in his prayer to God concerning the Calling of the Gentiles into the ſaid poſture, doth rightly point at the manner of Chriſts Spirit ſtriving with mans ſpirit, ſaying, God perſwade Iaphet to dwell in the Tents of Shem, that is not only by a moral perſwaſion in the voice of the Goſpel, but alſo by the Spirit of Chriſt, the rectitude of the Underſtanding and the Will rightly to operate, to receive the ſaid gift of Chriſts Righteouſneſs and life in it, and thus always God proceeds with the ſpirits of men ordinarily in all the world,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.20.</note> except in caſe of Reſtauration of the World from one univerſal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, then as is proved,
<note place="margin">Act. 2.17.</note> God is found of them that ſought him not, as in the Call of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and pouring out the imbreathing of his Spirit, as it were compelling the Gentiles into the ſaid poſture by a more cleerer manifeſtation to their minds in the Goſpel being unvailed then ever the Iews had, but ſtill this muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that this extraordinary Cauſe is in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his final end, againſt the Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſign againſt the ſaid particular Branch
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:179408:58"/>and therefore not for mans ſake, but for his own Names ſake; for to this end, he gives to ſome a greater emminency of Gifts and Graces throughout all Ages and Generations of men as to Moſes, Abraham, Daniel, and David, and the ſeventy Diſciples, and the Apoſtles, and ſo forth; but in an ordinary courſe God proceeds with men to give them more Faith, and ſo of every Grace according as they are faithful in their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and not otherwiſe.</p>

As for Example, The Nature of God in the perſon of Chriſt breathed upon the Apoſtles, and indued them with an Apoſtolical ſpirit; that is, in the Rectitude of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in Divine light, and their Wills in pure affections in love to his Glory in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the World by the Goſpel; yet ſtill that virtue in its Effects in them was one thing, and his Divine Nature or Eſſence in himſelf was another thing,

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179408:59"/>Apoſtles bodies God was pleaſed to put forth himſelf by vertue flowing from himſelf to the cure of many diſeaſed people as they went in the ſtreets; yet the peoples bodies that were cured, and the ſhadow of the Apoſtles bodies, and the virtue that flowed from God, and Gods own Eſſence were all diſtinct things in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Natures and Kindes; even ſo, when God gave being to the Reaſonable Soul, by breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into mans Noſtrils, the breath of lives his own Divine Nature,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> and that Creative power, another thing by which he was pleaſed to put forth to the production of mans Reaſonable Soul, and as formerly is proved; the Eſſence of God is one thing; and that Radical virtue or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is another thing in its Effects; ſo when he was pleaſed to reduce that virtue and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to act creatively, that was another thing; from which thing it is, that the Creature is the Off-ſpring of God, from whom it ſprang, and in whom it continually is, and cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<note place="margin">Act. 17.18.</note> he being Infinite: In him we live, move, and have our being; but for the manner how we live; move, and have our being; is known to God alone, and not perceived by us; but becauſe Gods Word hath ſaid it, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
            <p>Again,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.17.</note> for the next Text, that Believers are one ſpirit with the Lord: The Text refers it onely to Believers, and not to all man kinde; as the drift of your opinion point at: for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179408:59"/>words are theſe, But he that is joyned or clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the Lord is one ſpirit with him, and is appoſed to thoſe that did joyn or cleave in their minds, as well as with their bodies to Harlots, yet theſe men and women were not one ſpirit Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but Individually ſtill they were twain, ſo on the contrary, true Blievers are of one ſpirit in pure Affections, cleaving to God and Chriſt; yet nevertheleſs the Divine Eſſence of God is one thing, and ſtill their bodies and ſouls are two diſtinct Natures, ſo the ſcope of this Text is directly againſt your opinion.</p>
            <p>Again, for the next Text, in regard it refers Believers to Gods precious Promiſes, and Faith,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4, 5.</note> and Love, and Virtue, and Knowledge, to flee the Corruptions that are in the World through Luſts, and that by theſe they are partakers of the Divine Nature, they all imploy the uſe of their operations, as flowing from their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties to the ſaid ſutable Rule, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt; therefore the ſcope of this Text alſo, is againſt your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Again, the other Texts, Chriſt in you the hope of Glory, the drift of it is no more but this,
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.23, 27.</note> That Chriſt dwells in Believers hearts by Faith and Love, from whence they live in hope of a full fruition and glory with him for ever in the next Life. But as for your blaſpeamous Error, If you be the Divine Nature Eſſentially,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179408:60"/>it fully injoys it ſelf infinitely; therefore your Error is Contrary to the Nature of Hope, therefore the drift of this Text is alſo againſt you.</p>
            <p>Again, Whereas you alleadge the Texts of Scripture, and the like, it is onely an Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to draw mens minds from believing the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures to be Gods Word, to believe that the onely true Scriptures is the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, eſſentially in themſelves, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye; for what man can believe that is in his right minde, that himſelf is God or Chriſt; and yet cannot walk upon the Sea as Chriſt did: nor deliver himſelf out of the hand of his enemies, and not render himſelf into their hands till he pleaſed, as did the Lord Jeſus Chriſt when his hour was come, nor cauſe the Sun to go back ſo many degrees as pleaſeth themſelves as God did.</p>
            <p>Again, for Concluſion take this one Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more from the precedent premiſes:
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10, 11, 12, 13.</note> Namely, that there is a threefold ground why God made a Law that Infants as ſuch, ſhould be members of Chriſts viſible Church, and ſo under the uſe of Ordinances in the Church.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:179408:60"/>
            <p>The firſt is this, becauſe the whole Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſuch God Elected in the perſon of Chriſt the ſeed of the Woman in the faln Maſs out of that fall into a capacity of the ſaid poſture in which they might if they lived to the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by belief, receive in the gift of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Eternal Life as is proved, and this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the firſt ground of their right to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts viſible Church, and ſo the firſt ground why God gave that Law, Hence it is that Chriſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.14.</note> ſuffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>A Second Ground is this, If the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation have a right of relation to Chriſt by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Righteouſneſs imputed, as interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the unrighteouſneſs of Adams imputed, and by it travels untill now, as is proved. Then much more hath Humane Nature as ſuch a right of relation to be Chriſts viſible Church, and this was the ſecond ground of that Law why Infants ſhould be members, the which Law was never repealed.</p>
            <p>A third Ground was this, Becauſe as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, all mankinde dying in Infancy or the like, aſcended to Heaven, and there are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church Triumphant, therefore much more have they a right to the Church Militant, and all Churches and Ordinances here upon Earth, the which right can never
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179408:61"/>be loſt, except they live to be able to act unbelieving Operations, and ſo put away their right, as did Eſaw, judging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life, and this is a third Ground of that Law, whereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are inſtituted Members of the Viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
